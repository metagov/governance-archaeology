'Each family creates ties which distribute its risk over the population and thereby assure that losses will be covered in bad years.' (Wiessner (1982), p. 66)

'The hxaro relationship involves a balanced, delayed exchange of gifts, whose continuous flow gives both partners information about the underlying status of the relationship - one of a bond of a friendship accompanied by mutual reciprocity and access to resources. In addition, each partnership links a person to a broad network of hxaro paths' (Wiessner (1982), p. 66)

'Among the Ju/'hoansi, punishment typically does not take place through witchcraft, financial reparations, socially sanctioned duels, or violent retribution. Rather, most punishment takes place in conversations, or at least it begins as talk' (Wiessner 2005 p. 121)

'Punishment was divided into four categories: (a) put-downs through pantomime, joking, or mocking, (b) mild criticism and complaint, (c) harsh criticism or complaints, and (d) criticism plus violent acts' (p. 122)

Both men and women initiated criticisms and punished others

Ostracism for women who developed relations with Bantu men

Retaliation against perpetrators went from mocking and joking to harsh criticisms and violence

Culture (from Wiessner 2005):
''Strong reciprocity occurs when individuals are willing ""to sacrifice resources for rewarding fair and punishing unfair behavior, even if this is costly and provides neither present nor future rewards for the reciprocator"" (Fehr, Fischbacher, and Gachter 2002:3).' (Wiessner (2004), p. 116)'

'Strong reciprocity requires high levels of monitoring within the group and subsequent action to bring individual behavior in line through reward and punishment.' (p. 116)

'Foragers live in cooperative communities where food is shared widely and children are reared by a range of ""alloparents"" from grandparents to siblings (Draper 1976; Hewlett 2001; Hrdy 1999; Konner 1975). Widespread food sharing prevails within the community (camp), reducing variance in subsistence income, supporting those who are not capable of providing their own food at certain points in their lives, and promoting cooperation' (p. 117)

'Egalitarian relations (Boehm I993, 1996, 1999; Cashdan 1980; Clastres 1977; Gardner 1991; Kelly 1995) are maintained among foragers to facilitate reciprocity and cooperation on five accounts (Wiessner 2002a). (a) They standardize certain information by specifying that all adult members of the society are autonomous equals who cannot command, bully, coerce, or indebt others. (b) They reduce the risks of cooperation because people do not fear that assistance given in the present will be used to dominate in the future. (c) They stipulate that it is the obligation of all people to stand up for their interests and permit all individuals to punish norm defectors, if they choose to do so. (d) They allow individuals and families to choose different options when environmental conditions require dispersal. (e) They facilitate mobility between visiting groups because hierarchies do not mesh easily. Egalitarian institutions vary in how encompassing they are, that is, whether they include adults of both sexes and all ages, and whether equality applies to both opportunity and outcome (Flanagan 1989; Robbins 1994). For the Ju/'hoansi, as for many foragers, equality applies to all adults and to equality of opportunity as well as equality of outcome.' (p. 117)","20th century - Present

In addition to belonging to a deme, citizens were associated with one of ten new artificially created “tribes” that now each sent 50 individuals, selected by lot, to a Council of 500 that would administer the day-to-day affairs of the city.' (p. 32)

From 462 BCE, even the lower classes, thetes, could hold office

'The Greek city-states for the most part failed to establish command-and-control bureaucracies. Nor did the Greek world develop an integrated master social or theological narrative that would have provided ideological support for the necessity of individual obedience to central authority' (Ober, Josiah (2015), p. 60)

'quasi-federal institutional reforms in the aftermath of a democratic revolution (ch. 7). Federalism was widely adopted in mainland Greece in the fourth century BCE (ch. 9). Federalist and quasi-federalist institutional experiments allowed Greek states to operate as extensive “networks of social networks”—and thereby contributed to solving the problem of monitoring and punishing free riders.' (p. 68)

Community rewards to those 'who lead efforts to punish malefactors.' (p. 68)

'Under Cleisthenes’ reformed constitutional order, 139 villages, towns, and neighborhoods of Attica were designated “demes.” An average deme had a free adult male population of 150– ­250, although some were smaller, and others, notably Aphidna and Acharnai, much larger.' (Ober, Josiah (2015), p. 162)

'Each Athenian was thus treated as a citizen at different levels: locally in his deme and at the federal level of the polis. All free adult males resident in Attica in the year of the reform were, in the immediate aftermath of the revolution, considered to be citizens of Athens and of their deme of residence. Moreover, the deme would hereafter be the fundamental unit of Athenian citizenship: To be a citizen of Athens, a male resident of Attica must be formally recognized by an assembly of citizens in his deme as having been born to an Athenian father who was himself a citizen of the deme, and as being at least 18 years of age.' (p. 162-4)

'Two intermediate levels of belonging connected the demes to the federal state. Citizens of each deme were assigned to one of ten newly created artificial “tribes.” Each tribe enrolled roughly a tenth of the citizens, drawn from three distinct regions of Attica.' (p. 164)

'Perhaps most importantly, the membership of the new central state Council of 500, which conducted Athens’ day-­ to-­ day public affairs and set the agenda for the legislative citizen assembly, was recruited through the new deme/tribe system. In later years, at least, councilors were aged 30 and older, were chosen by lot, and were paid for their service. Each of the 10 tribes annually provided 50 councilors. The members of each tribal contingent of 50 were chosen at the deme level, each deme sending a certain number of councilors according to population.' (p. 164)

'But Cleisthenes had not introduced to Athens what we think of today as “representative government” because councilors were not expected to represent the particularistic interests of their deme, regional third, or tribe. Nor were they accountable to local voters. Rather, the councilors served, collectively, as a microcosm of the Athenian citizenry. They represented what, in the aggregate, the Athenian people knew and the skills and information the Athenians could bring to bear on problems confronting the state.' (p. 164)

Areopagus
- 'membership was drawn from ex-­magistrates' (p. 166)

'The Athenian citizenry elected their military leaders; many other state officials were, however, chosen by lottery. All officials, elected or lotteried, were subject to ex ante public scrutiny and held publicly accountable, on an annual basis, for their performance.' (p. 168)

'Each year, the Athenian assembly decided whether to conduct an ostracism; if the decision was positive (as it was only 15 recorded times in Athenian history), the citizenry chose, by plurality written ballot, which prominent member of the Athenian elite to expel from the community for 10 years.' (p. 168)

The Council met almost daily, whilst the Assembly met four times each month

'The Solonian people’s court was subdivided into a number of courts, so that many more cases could now be judged by panels of citizens, chosen by lottery.' (p. 168)

'Federalism enabled trust among citizens, arising from local interactions at the deme level, to be leveraged at the level of the tribe and then at the level of the polis.' (p. 170)

'The deme-­tribe-­polis federal system helped to make the mass meetings of the Athenian assembly both less daunting and less clientalistic, as ordinary citizens developed social networks that extended at least to the tribe level.' (p. 171)

'Athenian citizens proved to be quite good at identifying and attending to experts and quite capable of using the knowledge of experts for the ends of policy-­ making without turning state management over to them.'

Political organization varies by area (North-east has collective governance vs. West has leaders)

Political org. in the NE (p. 226-234)

The villages are headed by a big man who acts as a primus inter pares

Several villages constitute a vicinage, which is ruled collectively by representatives of the founding matrilineages in a council 

The council is composed of the members of the highest rank of the ngongo munene, a sodality that includes several ranks
-	The lower ranks are open to all men
-	The higher are occupied by heredity, reputation, and the paying of large fees

A female equivalent exercised authority over women but we know too little about the organization (dual-sex?)

Vicinages come together in alliances 

Professional hunters come together in a buyanga, an association that crosses several vicinages (elite club)

Excerpts: 
'He was therefore the de facto leader of the village, or at least a primus inter pares. He had direct control over all the marriages of the girls of his settlement, which is an indication of the ﬁerce competition for members between big men and their respective Houses or villages.' (p. 230)

'The vicinage was ruled collectively from a designated special place by representatives of those matrilineages thought to have ﬁrst settled on the land and to which the leaders of each House in the vicinage belonged. Both the grouping of such founding lineages and the place of their meeting were called ekuluwandá 9/6 , an expression which contains the notion of ngandá 9/10, a notion that designated all the inhabitants of the vicinage and is best translated as “society.”' (p. 230)

'Ekuluwandá, then, is the “place of the elders of the society.” This collective government was exercised on behalf of all the constituent settlements and of all age-related initiation groups. It was expressed through the performances of the sodality called ngongo munene or “great territory.” This sodality included three or four ranked levels complete with a hierarchy of masks marked in diﬀerent ways to indicate their rank. Induction into the initial rank of the association was voluntary, collective, and open to all adult men. Accession to higher ranks was, in part, hereditary in that it had to be patriﬁlial but descent was not enough. Candidates had to have the approval of the members of the rank they wanted to join, and they had to pay a hefty entrance fee.' (p. 231)

'Government was exercised by members of the highest rank of the ngongo munene. These were the mutúmbú 3/4 who decreed the necessary measures for all collective endeavors from organizing collective hunts to initiations, war, and the adjudication of all court cases.' (p. 231)

'The female equivalent of the ngongo munene exercised authority over women with regard to issues concerning them, but data are sorely lacking concerning their ruling organization.' (p. 232)

'in the late nineteenth century and undoubtedly also in earlier times, details of its institutions diﬀered from district to district. In some places, there were four ranks of the governing association and in others only three; in some places, such as among the Sala Mpasu, individual big men held more power than the ruling sodality, while in other places the balance of power tilted in favor of the sodality, as among the Kongo-Dinga.' (p. 233)

- 'Still, in essence, it remained the same system: everywhere society was structured by a hierarchy of age-sets and governed collectively by an oligarchy.' (p. 233)

Political org. in the WEST (p. 234 –244)

'While people in the northeast of the region developed collective governance, their neighbors to the west took a slightly diﬀerent path by choosing to strengthen the authority of individual leaders in villages and vicinages without enlarging the scale of governance much beyond that of a vicinage.' (p. 234)

'Frictions between villages, especially within the same vicinage, were settled by arbitration through common palavers in a thoroughly decentralized manner. In these assemblies, “speakers” (ngambi 9/10) for each matrilineage set out their positions, and decisions were reached by a consensus of the whole audience.' (p. 237)

- 'Ngambi were “big men.” They were chosen within each lineage for their wealth plus oratory talent and they enjoyed a status marked by special privileges and customs. 88 They also formed a sort of club or guild that transcended individual vicinages. The institutions of the palaver and the ngambi were the main overarching institutions that tied the villages of a vicinage together and which settled serious conﬂicts between neighboring vicinages.' (p. 237)

'Lwimbi 'decided to appoint their chiefs for a limited period of time only. Chiefs were installed ﬁrst for two years and could then be reconﬁrmed for a total of six or maximum of eight years.' (p. 247)

'Cologne’s leading patrician families had established de facto political control by the thirteenth century, the outcome of a dispute with Cologne’s archbishop' (Stasavage, States of Credit, p. 166, EPUB version)

'City finances were managed by the city council, which in turn relied on a chief financial official known as the rentmeister, as well as managers of three separate annuity chambers (rentkammern) or treasuries: the Wednesday Chamber, the Friday Chamber, and the Saturday Chamber' (p. 168)

'Beginning in 1216 formal authority in Cologne was exercised by the city council. This was a small body of fifteen members that was renewed each year and for which the fifteen new members of the incoming council were chosen by the outgoing council—a system of cooptation.' 'this selection mechanism ensured that control of the council remained with a small number of influential families' (p. 171)

Constitutional change: ""The popular revolt in 1396 led to the creation of a new constitution, the Verbundbrief , which was designed to ensure broader representation in Cologne’s governance. As a result of the 1396 reform... the selection method for the city council was altered. Political organization in the city was now to be based on 22 individual corporations, or Gaffel. Five of these were associations of merchants, and the remaining seventeen were designed to represent Cologne’s numerous craft guilds. The Gaffel in turn elected 36 of the 49 members of a new city council. The remaining thirteen members were to be selected by the first thirty-six.' (p. 171)

The new constitution does not alter the power structure: 
'while the Gaffel now elected thirty-six of the forty-nine council members, the heads of each Gaffel were not themselves chosen in an open election by all members—they were instead selected by a special committee of more prominent members'

Contrary to previous scholarship, Reynolds advocates for a similarity of social and political institutions across Europe (p. 7-8)

""Early medieval government, then, was in its own way both
constitutional and representative: constitutional because
kings were supposed to be limited by law, custom and consultation; and representative, firstly because the king made
and declared law as the supreme representative of his people,
and secondly because those with whom he was supposed to
consult were themselves representative. The bishops and
nobles of a kingdom, like the senior and richer landowners of
a province or village, were, in the terms of the time, those
who were qualified to speak on behalf of the collectivity of
which they were the most solid, respectable, and responsible
members."" p. 22

CH 1: LAW
Like in anglo saxon England, ""assemblies"" dealt with legal and legislative matters. In the communes, assemblies' judicial functions included judgment as well as arbitration and mediation. (p. 25)

Assemblies were presided by a president, either the king himself or a representative. Judges could be elites (scabini), iudices, or laymen, and could be appointed by the president or include all the present. Variation depended on the circumstances of the case.

Collective judgment did not apply to unfree peasants (judged by their lord) and cases in which a single judge is in charge (possibly, for more esoteric judgment having to do with roman law). (p 31-2)

judgments were sworn (p.33)

Evolution over time: ""There can be no doubt that the twelfth and thirteenth centuries began to bring important changes to the ideas and practices of law. The strengthening of government began to transform the law by emphasizing one source of its authority and enforcement among others. More and more crimes came to incur formal punishments, inflicted by the authority of the ruler, instead of being left to mutual negotiation by feud and wergeld. Although in practice the maintenance of law and order still depended in large measure on collective self-policing, it was now the king’s (or sometimes the count’s or duke’s) peace which the law-breaker broke. The old amorphous assemblies were replaced by something more like modern law-courts, working within something more like
defined jurisdictions, and these gradually began to be organized into hierarchies of superior and inferior authority.’ Meanwhile the keeping of records reduced the flexibility of
custom at the same time that the increasing pace of secular
legislation, combined with religious reform and the extension
of papal jurisdiction, started to cast doubt on its inherent
validity. (p. 39)

CH 6 URBAN POLITICS
Assemblies were a fact of life (p. 164), likely to be meeting regularly (p. 167). 

The chapter focuses overwhelmingly on the later period and on cities already present in the database either individually (like Pisa, Genoa, Venice etc) or as a group (imperial and free town of the holy roman empire). Whereas forms of autonomous governance also continued both in France (local mayors) and England (see entry for anglo-saxon England), monarchical presence seems to have been stronger here than in italy and germany. (p. 178-180)

A generic account of political institutions in independent cities is provided on pp. 188-196, summarized as follows: ""vocabularies differed, and so did the degree of complexity, but the framework of councils and offices, rotating part-time service, assemblies, elections, and audits was very much the same.

- States-General, an assembly comprising representatives of each of the seven provinces (each has one vote aiming at unanimity in theory but often using majority {cf. Israel p. 276), rotating presidency with one province chairing meetings for one week at a time)
- Council of State, the executive of the States General

Governing organs in each state varied but included (from Israel):
- A provincial assembly, representing the towns (but only some could vote)
- a standing committee, setting the agenda

AS FOR TOWN GOVERNANCE, it included:
- a permanent council (vroedschap) - cooptive and whose members had life appointments
- magistrates

Pharaoh relied heavily on his advisors when making decisions. As such, Royal Court had high enough authority to impose corporal punishments. Vizier, acting as Pharaoh's deputy, oversaw the administration of the Royal Court and partook in the decision-making process. Royal Court itself was heavily bureaucratic just like Egypt in general and was divided into various departments such as treasury, police, district, and each department had its main overseer who had to answer to Vizier. To ensure Vizier's informedness there was an institution of 'Hearers' who acted as the system of bureaucratic control. 

There were also local Pharaoh's administrations around Egypt run by the Herald, who informed Pharaoh of people's aspirations and acted as pharaoh's mouthpiece.

For local decision-making and legal proceedings there were two councils - Djadjat and Qenbet. Djadjat was the dominant council in the Old and Middle Kingdoms, and Qenbet was dominant in the New Kingdom. However, they both did exist during all three kingdoms just with varying levels of importance. From the readings, I got the impression that Qenbet was more concerned with local justice and Djadjat with local governance. They were run by local notables such as Mayors and Priests.


A story about the 'Eloquent Peasant' that shows the Egyptian Institution of Petitioning:

----- BACKSTORY OF ROBBERY -----
p. 1
“There was a man called Khunanup. He was a peasant of the Wadi Natrun and he had a wife called Meret”
“This peasant said to his wife of his: ‘Look, I am going to Egypt to fetch provisions there for my children’”
p. 3
“[???]”
p. 5
“He [peasant] came across a man”
“His name was Nemtinakht and he was the son of a man called Isry”
“These were liegemen of the high steward Rensi, son of Meru”
“And the Nemitinakht said, when he saw the donkeys of this peasant, which were desirable to his heart:”
p. 6
“‘Would that I had some divine image with which I could rob the good of this peasant!”
“Now, the house of the Nemtinakht was at a waterside path that was narrow, it was not broad: it measured the width of a loincloth. Its one side was under water, the other=er under barley.”
“This Nemtinankht then said to a servant of his:”
p. 7
“’Hurry, and bring me a cape from my house!’”
“Then he spread it out on the waterside path, so that its hem came to rest on water, and its selvage on the barley.”
“And this peasant came on the public path”
“This Nemtinakht then said: ‘Beware, peasant, you will not step on my clothes!”
p. 8
“And the peasant said: ‘I shall do what you wish; my way is good.’”
“And he went up higher. Then this Nemtinakht said: ‘Is my Upper-Egyptian barley to be a path for you?’”
“And this peasant said: ‘My ways are good; the bank is steep, and the ways are under barley for you block our path with your clothes!’”
p. 9
“’Will you then not allow us to pass on the path?’”
“As he had finished saying […] words, then one of the donkeys filled its mouth with a wisp of barley.”
“And this Nemtinakht said: ‘But look, your donkey is eating my barley!”
p. 10
… “I will buy my donkey for 10 times the value”
“Now, I know the lord of this district; it belongs to the high steward Rensi, son of Meru. He is the one who restrains every thief in this entire land.”
“Shall I now be robbed in his district?”
p. 11
…
“Then, he [Nemtinakht] took a rod of fresh tamarisk to him, and he thrashed all his [peasant’s] limbs with it, took his donkey away and drove them to his district”

----- STORY OF PETITIONING -----
p. 13
“Then this peasant spent a period of 10 days pleading with this Nemtinakht, but he did not pay attention to it.”
“This peasant then went to Herakleopolis in order to plead with the high steward Rensi, son of Meru”
p. 14
“He [peasant] found him [high steward Rensi] emerging from the door of his house, to step into his official boat.”
“And this peasant said: ‘May I be allowed to inform you about this grievance. Perhaps one may have a servant of your choice come to me, so that I may have him report to you about it.’”
p. 15-16
“And the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, had a servant of his choice go to him, and this peasant had him report back about this entire matter.”
“Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, accused the Nemitinakht to the officials who were with him.”
“But then they said to him: ‘Perhaps it is a peasant of his who went to someone else behind him. Look, that is what they do to peasants of theirs who have gone to others beside them. That is what they do. Is this a cause for punishing this Nemtinakht, on account of I little natron and a little salt? If he is ordered to replace it, then he will replace it.’”
p. 16
“But the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, remained silent.”
p. 17
“He did not answer these officials, nor did he answer this peasant.”
“Then this peasant came to pleas with him”
p. 21
“The high steward Rensi, son of Meru, then went before His Majesty and said: ‘My lord, I have found one of these peasants who is truly eloquent. By a man who is my peer. His goods have been robbed. He has come to please with me about it.’”
p. 22-23
“And His Majesty said: ‘As you wish to see me in health, you will delay him here without answering anything he says. So that he keeps speaking, remain silent. So that his speech will be brought to us in writing. So that we may hear it. But provide sustenance for the wife and children of this peasant. That one of these peasants comes here is because his house is empty. […] Furthermore, provide sustenance for this peasant himself. You will let the provisions be given to him without letting him know.’”
p. 24
“They were given to friends of his and his friends gave them to him.”
“Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, sent a message to the mayor of the Wadi Natrun about making provisions for the wife of this peasant.”
p. 36
“And the peasant came to plead with him for a third time”
P. 44
“When this peasant had said these words, the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, went to the entrance of the portal…”
p. 45
“…and made two guards turn against him with whips, and they thrashed all his limbs therewith”
p. 54
“You were appointed to hear cases, to judge between litigants and to punish the robber”
“But look, what you are doing is supporting the thief”
p. 59
“…and your environment is corrupt. And every man in your environment is corrupt”
p. 60
“High steward, my lord, you are the helm of the entire land, the land sails in accordance with your command. You are the equal of Thoth, who judges without being partial.”
p. 64
“Yet officials should be people who dispel injustice, lords of goodness, craftsmen in creating what is, people who men a severed head.”
p. 71
“And this peasant came to plead with him for a ninth time”
p. 76
“Look, I am pleading with you but you do not hear it.”
“I will go and plead concerning you with Anubis.”
“Then, the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, sent two guards to bring him back”
…
p. 77
“Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, said: ‘Don’t be afraid, peasant! Look, you will arrange the matter with me’” …
p. 78
“The high steward Rensi, son of Meru, said: ‘Now wait here and hear your petitions!’ And from a new papyrus roll he had every petition read out according to [its] content”
“Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, delivered them to the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Nebkaure, justified and they pleased his heart more than anything in his entire land.”
p. 79
“Then His Majesty said: ‘Pass judgement yourself, son of Meru!’
“And the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, sent two guards to [fetch Nemtinakht] Then he was brought and inventory was made of”
p. 80
“this Nemitankht […] to this peasant […] […] […] all his”

Inclusion in the community proceeds not through formal qualification but through marriage, kinship, or birth  - but the qualification is not mandatory. Members are feee to leave.

Decisions are arrived at through discussions in which all adult and near-adult members can participate. Gatherings are often unnecessary (though announcement of the decision to the band is) unless the matter is contentious. if the matter is contentious then the factions will air their views before a wider audience, this could be a few individuals or a public harangue.

Leadership is the ability to command a following in decision-making. It often depends on ""knowledge, experience of the matter, and firmness of personality"" p. 29.

Discussions are carried out in a calm atmosphere. the band is reluctant to come o. decisions under the sway of strong feelings. when things get heated, people withdraw their attention auditorily. Matters discussed are both private and public.

Interpersonal conflict and norm transgression is attained by judgment, arbitration, and reconciliation.

Band decisions are arrived at by consensus, which is the elimination of discarded alternatives, rather than unanimity or lack of disagreement. p. 31-2

From Robinson 2011:

""For Aristotle, demokratia exists in a city-state when the people control the governing structure..The demos' control is expressed by its domination of public assembly meetings which all citizens can attend; juries also have broad authority and are in the hands of the people. Further typical characteristics include the allotment, and sometimes election, of magistrates from and by all citizens...Offices have short term and are not to be filled repeatedly by the same person.. Magistrates are held accountable... by various means...Ostracism is typical, as is pay for attending jury courts and assemblies."" (Robinson p. 222-3)

o	‘The Confederation made it possible for the Iroquois peoples to remain sovereign over their vast territories until the end of the eighteenth century.’ (305)
o	‘For all three of these peoples, the deep-seated cultural changes were not confined to ending the priestly-elite; they also led to a new form of government that fundamentally ended hierarchical, male-dominated, hereditary privileges. This was the basis on which the Iroquois created their brilliant Constitution and celebrated Confederation—which is excellent evidence of a great, matriarchally-based society oriented to the common good.’ (301)
o	‘Clans are female, but include males; nations are male, but include females. All matters must circulate in an ongoing process between these two polar powers.’
o	‘Traditionally, the local and federal were interdependent, equivalent entities, rather than having been hierarchically ordered the way they are in patriarchal dominance societies. The local represented the sacred will of the people, the “grassroots level” of Mother Earth herself, and was run by the clan mothers. In the local clan houses, all decisions were made by consensus among all clan members, and all clan houses were represented in the Women’s Clan Council, an elected body presided over by the Jigonsaseh.’ (305-06)
o	‘The federal side, presided over by the men, was made up not of clans, but of nations, as represented in the League of the Nations in the Men’s Grand Council. Although decisions and messages were communicated and handled here, they did not originate here. The men might only discuss an issue after the women had gone over it, which made the Women’s Clan Council the more powerful one— their deliberations effectively set the men’s agenda. Similarly, if the Men’s Grand Council did not dispose of an issue in the way that the Women’s Clan Council preferred, the women could take up the matter anew, reformulate it, and send it back to the men for reconsideration. This means the women’s council retained what amounted to a judicial review of men’s actions, and could stop them; the men’s council could not do the same to the women’s actions. However, this does not mean the Women’s Clan Council had too much power, because it included the consensus not just of the women in the council, but the consensus of the people—all the clan houses, including the women, men, and children who belonged to them.’ (306)
o	‘The Women’s Clan Council, as sole authority at the local level of government, is the first right of women explicitly granted in the Constitution. The second explicit right is that women are the exclusive guardians of war and peace; that is, they had the right to decide these matters. The concept behind this is that, in order to secure the future of society, women and children must have the absolute right to peace and security. To achieve this, Iroquoian women retained the weapons, relinquishing them only when the Women’s Clan Council had resolved to suspend women’s right to peace, having made this public through their spokespersons, the clan mothers or their male speakers. However, in their traditional way of life this happened only very rarely, for the clan mothers were not interested in sacrificing their children’ (306)
o	‘These two political rights of women may seem to imply that the Iroquois gave too much weight to female power, but in their law, an additional provision emphasized male power. This emphasis emerges in the distinction between “hereditary chiefs,” or clan peace chiefs, whose job was to protect the “Innocents,” resolve conflict, and manage inter-national negotiations, and “merit chiefs,” whose selection was based on their various services to the community. Hereditary chiefs were selected exclusively by women for specific council seats held by the clans, whereas merit chiefs were selected exclusively by men; their selection was based on their merit, although hereditarily seats did not exist. For men, in addition to showing mature judgement, one of the ways to earn merit was by acting as a war chief, a position chosen by men after women had given war a go-ahead.’ (306)
o	‘A feud took place after being decided upon in the war council. In this council, lines of relationship played no role since the merit chief, who sat in the war council, was not elected on the basis of clan structures. Thus, feuds were the formal reason for the resolutions of war council, but often this masked the young men’s thirst for adventure and ambitions for advancement. Feuds were carried out based on private initiative of volunteers, and whether or not a feud actually went forward depended completely on the war chief ’s popularity. He would dig up the hatchet (a red-painted tomahawk decorated with red feathers) and plunge it into the village war post. Then, fully adorned and emitting loud war cries, he would begin the war dance. By then, everyone in the village knew that a feud was planned, and those who voluntarily chose to follow the chief joined in the war dance. However, just as often, no one danced with him, and he went home in disgrace.’ (307-308)
o	‘The Iroquois could not undertake feuds without the explicit consent of women. Additionally, the young men who set off in a war party had to be supplied by the women with long-lasting provisions of cornmeal; otherwise, they could not carry out these forays. The women apportioned the food not only for the feuds, but also for the trade expeditions, so the final decisions about these things were in women’s hands. By withholding their political and economic assent, women in the village or town could stop a feud from taking place. And they did stop it, when the elder lineage chiefs thought it was a bad idea.’ (308)
o	‘The house-based council was not only for handling household matters; it was, at the same time, the vehicle for general policy. The chosen representatives of the Ohwachira participated in clan, town, and federal politics. Every Ohwachira had, in addition, the right to launch political initiatives and could convey the Ohwachira’s wishes and expectations to bodies at the nation level and federal level. In this way, households reflected the wishes and claims of all Iroquois—and even of children, as the voting rules weighted a woman’s vote according to the number of children she had. All political opinion and decision-making was based on household councils. Thus, the social and political order presented itself not as a top-down domination, but as a network based on consensus building from below.’ (310)
o	‘If an Ohwachira possessed a hereditary political office, the opportunities for influencing the greater community expanded considerably. The Sachems were chosen in councils made up of the clan mothers and adult women. The Royaneh had the last word, but, once consensus was achieved, she could not overrule it. Aptitude and experience were deciding factors. In this way, women selected the representatives who made up the political bodies in the town, the nation, and in the League. Therefore, these hereditary chiefs acted primarily in the interests of their own clans, particularly the women. Iroquoian women were present at men’s gatherings and heard everything that went on, and so had great political influence and responsibility.’ (310)
o	‘Sachems, or Peace Chiefs, were responsible for quickly resolving conflicts, whether at the town, national, or federal level, and they took the initiative to settle disputes. Nevertheless, by possessing this title, a man became the delegate of his Ohwachira, so that each Sachem was dependent upon the instructions of the Royaneh. In response to poor performance, or headstrong behavior, or infringement of the ideals or laws of the Confederation, she could unseat him. Custom dictated that an offending Sachem would be warned three times: first by the Royaneh acting alone; then by the clan’s male speaker, the Young Man; and finally by the Royaneh and the Young Man together. If all these did not produce results, the Royaneh would revoke the Sachem’s title and his emblems, giving them to another chosen clan representative. The entire clan would of course be paying attention to the Royaneh’s administrative leadership, and she too could be replaced after three warnings’ (310)
o	‘Also at the national councils, the two clan chiefs—Royaneh and Sachem—were present, but the management of this differed among different nations. The Attiwendaronk were a very special group, their national council seems to have had the maximum number of female members possible: four fifths of their council chiefs were women. The clan mothers were in just about total control among the Attiwendaronk. The Confederacy, however, modified that to a more parallel system of national councils as sphere of men, and clan councils as sphere of women. There were also female chiefs at the level of the Confederation; in fact, there were just as many women as men. This was verified by a white woman ethnologist, who herself was a Seneca female chief in the Iroquois Confederation (Harriet Converse).49 During the wars of conquest, the Gantowisas saw themselves as being obliged to assume, in national and federal councils, the roles of imprisoned and murdered Sachems. In these desperate situations the Seneca and Attiwendaronk Gantowisas even took up arms, fighting as soldiers alongside the men: in 1687 the League’s Jigonsaseh personally assumed military control, and handed the French a heavy defeat in 1689, near Montreal.’ (310-11)
o	‘all these kinship groups and political groups were traditionally responsible to the Councils of Elders; these bodies aggregated the experience and wisdom of age and took vigilant care to ensure that Sachems’ decisions were compatible with traditional social values. They were the guardians of the culture’s unwritten laws. However, the women’s councils spoke first and controlled the agenda of both the Grandmothers’ and Grandfathers’ councils’’ (311)

o	‘The 7,500,000 Igbo who live east of the Niger River traditionally had what Afigbo calls a “democratic village republic” system of political organization, with authority widely dispersed in autonomous units.’ (47)
o	‘The remaining 500,000 Igbo on the western side of the Niger and in the riverine towns of Onitsha and Ossomali, heavily influenced by the kingdom of Benin to the north, developed what Afigbo calls a “constitutional village monarchy” system.’ (47)
o	‘In both types of systems the units were small, and political authority was widely dispersed along the following lines: between the sexes; among lineages and kinship institutions; by age grades; among secret and title societies; and among oracles, diviners, and other professional groups. There was no clear separation between judicial, executive, and legislative functions, and no distinction between the political and the religious in the governmental process. Both systems were what we characterized earlier as dual-sex systems: each sex generally managed its own affairs and had its own kinship institutions, age grades, and secret and title societies.’ (47)
o	The Omu did not derive her status from any linkage to the king (e.g. through power heritage or marriage). She wasn't a queen in the Western sense
o	‘In addition to the omu, her councillors, and the ikporo ani, who represented the entire women’s constituency, there were other women’s political institutions in the traditional Igbo system that function on a small base. Among these were the umuada and the inyemedi, which operated at the village or lineage level. Since Igbo society was exogamous and patrilocal, a woman had to leave her natal village when she married. To deal with the dislocations of this system and insure a simulated lineage structure for married women, a system of reciprocal ties was built up between a woman’s two villages – the one in which she was born and the one into which she married. Women thus came to have two homes. In their natal village they were umuada, or daughters of the lineage and/or village; in the village of their marriage they were inyemedi (co-wives), i.e., co-wives of the village or lineage. In both they formed themselves into an otu (organization), thus giving rise to otu umuada and otu inyemedi.’ (51-52)

from Sharma 1968:
Gana and Sangha are terms used to refer to the republican system of government or the state itself, in which “the supreme power was vested in a considerable portion of the population so qualified only on account of their birth, property or merit. The supreme power was exercised by a few of these rajas, elected from among themselves and more or less responsible to the qualified body who deliberated and took, in consultation with the latter, decisions that were binding on the entire population. The rulers derived their power, not from an individual, human or divine, above them, but from the qualified multitude. In short, it was a “government by discussion.”” p. 12

There are four different forms of such government by discussion in the early vedic period (1500-1000 BC) and a number of republican states still in the Buddhist period (600 – 480 BC)

1.	King, appointed for life by vis (more likely, the elders/heads of families.
a.	This type is widespread in the vedic period
2.	Government by a sabha (council) in a form of aristocratic oligarchy
3.	Government by a sabha (council) and a samiti (Assembly)
a.	In this form of government, the sabha holds the greatest authority
4.	Government by an assembly and an unspecified number of kings (rajanah)

Only types 2-4 are relevant here.

From Stasavage, pp. 36-7
'Rhys Davids highlighted the example of the Shakya—the clan of the buddha. The business of the clan took place in an assembly where both young and old were present, and it must have included taxation. The clan elected a single chief—known as the raja—to run the assembly sessions and to preside over the business of state. Rhys Davids thought that the raja must have had a position like a Roman consul—a presiding officer but not truly a superior.' (p. 36) 'the same texts also describe village governance involving an assembly of all householders' (p. 37)

From Muhlberger 1998
'The largest and most influential Indian literary tradition, the Brahmanical, is distinctly hostile to anything resembling democracy.' (p. 3)
- 'Brahmanical literature gives kingship a central place in political life, and seldom hints that anything else is possible. For moral philosophers and legislators such as Manu (reputed author of the Manu-Smrti between 200 B.C.-A.D. 200), the king was a key figure in a social order based on caste (varna).' (p. 3)
- 'Caste divided society into functional classes: the Brahmans had magical powers and priestly duties, the ksatriyas were the rulers and warriors, the vaisyas cultivators, and the sudras the lowest part of society, subservient to the other three. Moral law or dharma depended on the observance of these divisions, and the king was the guarantor of dharma, and in particular the privileges of the Brahmans.' (p. 3)
- However, 'non-monarchical forms of government were omnipresent' (p. 6); 'it seems that in the northwestern part of India, republicanism was the norm.' (p. 7)
- 'But in many states, perhaps most, political participation was restricted to a subset of all the ksatriyas. 


Culture:
'The Pali Canon, and to some extent the Jaina Canon, show us energetic movements that rejected the hierarchialism and caste ideology seen in the Vedas and Brahmanas in favor of more egalitarian values.' (p. 15)
- 'egalitarianism was an important element in the fifth century B.C' (p. 15)

'The title rājā has frequently been translated as king rather than chief. In many cases the later meaning of the term is applied to these early sources. Yet even in later periods the connotation of rājā has varied from landholder to king. The office of rājā in the Vedic sources was primarily that of a leader in battle and the protector of the settlements.' (Romila Thapar (1991), p. 36)

The distribution of landholding within a village involved collective choice arrangements. 
The land in the village was converted into shares, or 'subsections comprising fields of equal productivity' by 'universal agreement' or consensus amongst them. 
'The number of shares in a village was generally determined by the families in the village.' (p. 446) 
These shares could then be bought, sold, leased and divided fractionally. For fractional shares, groups forming one share could elect a representative to 'draw lots on behalf of the jointly held share.' 
Following this, 'the members of the group subdivided among themselves the plots allocated to that share during the lottery.' (p. 447)

Culture
Though figures of authority lacked physical force to enforce their decisions, the long tradition of the 'filial relationship' wherein the samurai/daimyo/shogun was considered a father-figure, meant that there was a 'habit of deference to and respect for superiors.'  Thus, 'The daimyo might not actually govern, but the men who did govern did not try to displace him or undercut his prestige' (p.10) This indicates strong patterns of loyalty

","There were around 27 provinces, controlled by either a shogun or a daimyo. Within a province, there were several villages. It is difficult to estimate the exact number of villages since the provinces were divided according to the amount of rice they produced and not the number of villages or the population. However, it can be roughly estimated that there were around 360 villages in each province based on its agricultural output. Each village had a council, which organised the corporate landholding process, as well as an assembly of all the citizens which voted on the distribution.

- Even this hka was distributed equally between the agyi, bawmung and Council. The Council members then gave it away to the families/lineages in most need of surplus crop. This was done after an unbiased consultation between the Elders and members would frequently give their share of the crop to another lineage in need, indicating altruism and solidarity.

o	Both women and men participate in market activities
o	‘The mother is not only the progenitor and head of the clan, but in her role as family priest also embodies a unifying principle. Responsibility for all family rituals lies with her, including the enormously important ceremonies for the dead. She is also custodian of all clan property: the communal house and land, and the income from the work of all the clan members. She inherits her position of official successor to the previous clan mother— her own mother. She is custodian of the clan’s property—not with an eye to her own gain, but for the whole clan, for whose well-being she is responsible. She guides distribution of the common wealth, taking care that it is shared out equally, and according to the needs of each, in a give-and-take economy that could well be called a clan internal “gift economy.” Her responsibility is based on natural bonds, not on abstraction, since all of the clan members are her sisters and brothers, her daughters and sons, for whom she cares. In the clan house, among her close relatives she is possessed of a natural authority, rather than a power over them, as encountered in patriarchal domination roles, where people’s needs and wants are not considered. Natural authority means, on her part, giving advice and, on their part, voluntary choice about accepting it or not: a relationship that develops out of family respect. In the clan house she has no staff of enforcement (no police, no army) to make her suggestions into commands.’ (48)
o	‘All the Khasi subgroups follow the matrilineal principle of descent, succession and inheritance. That means, the children carry the name of the mother’s clan and are members of it. Today the father’s clan is also recognized, and is honored; however, the father’s lineage plays no role, as most of the Khasi continue to emphasize matrilinear kinship and solidarity.’ (48)
o	‘The clan’s property remains in the mother’s clan and is passed on from mother to daughter—with minor variation in the different subgroups. With the Khasi it is the youngest daughter, or “Ka Khatduh,” who takes over the entire ancestral property and the material as well as the spiritual responsibility for the “Kur,” or clan: it is the principle of ultima-geniture. She is supported by her eldest maternal uncle, who carries out the actual management and execution of clan property following the consensus of all clan members. The Ka Khatduh is now the new head and priestess of the clan (sub-clan, lineage) and begins her duties with the funeral rites for her revered dead mother, whose devoted support she was until the last.’ (48-49)
o	‘The clan house is the basic political unit, where decisions are made by consensus in the “Durbar Iing,” or family council, which then sends out senior male clan members to represent them in the “Durbar Kur,” or clan council. The clan councils in turn send male representatives out to the “Durbar Shnong,” or local council. The British colonial government later superimposed a district council, which is a formal justice institution; this took away from the local councils the power to settle cases by consensus.’ (51-52)
o	‘Every durbar meeting takes place only with the consensual agreement of the women: without their agreement, no decision can be made.’ (52)
o	‘Neither is the woman a ruler sui generis, rather she only has the right to make decisions in the context of the clan, conforming to its unwritten rules’ (52)
o	‘Matriarchal societies cannot be labeled as democracies—that is a much later political concept—but rather as consensual clan societies. This means that the decision- making process belongs to all the clan members; their discussions are summarized and brought to completion by the clan mother as chief authority, then represented at the village council by the clan mother’s brother. In this way the U Kni’s role is that of a delegate rather than a ruler. The clan would never permit him to exceed the boundaries of this purely executive role by taking steps of his own. In this sense matriarchies are characterized by non-domination of women even while they hold full economic and spiritual authority.’ (52)
o	‘The role of the Khasi head-persons is a good example: the oldest clans may install the “Syiems” (chiefs, or kings) in the various districts that comprise Khasi Land. Using the case of the well-researched district of Khyrim, we can outline the pattern of this “Syiemship.” The Syiem of Khyrim is the son of the “Syiem Sad,” the high priestess of Khyrim. Not he, but rather she, is the actual head of the people; she allows her son or nephew to act as her delegate. She owns the large royal house, in which a sacred column functions as an axis that designates the center of the (Khasi) world. Symbolically speaking, she lives right at the center of the world. Every official sacrifice ceremony begins through her, at the sacred column, and ends there as well. She is the keeper of the symbols: without the crown and all the sacred tools and sacrificial animals no sacrifice can be celebrated. She always performs the first sacrificial act in the house; afterwards, she turns the tools and the animals over to the Syiem, her son, and lets him continue the ceremony outside. This allows her to watch him from her house’ (53)
o	‘The power of women in the matriarchal official structure was not, however, limited to the Syiem Sad. In the history of the Khasi people there have been instances of female Syiems, or queens, who either performed both functions— priestess and executive—or else were daughters of a Syiem Sad’ (54)

The Mother and Ka Khatduh had greater decision making power and control over the affairs of the clan. Even though male members were represented in the the durbar (council) by being appointed U kni, ""the U Kni’s role is that of a delegate rather than a ruler. The clan would never permit him to exceed the boundaries of this purely executive role by taking steps of his own. (52).""

in the last decade of the 6th c. there were around 20 city-states in Latium (p. 212-3)

after the Latin war, the city states are incorporated into the Roman state with full citizenhsip (p. 213). they become self-governing municipia

The average size of the cities was 200 sq.km. and the average population was probably around 5000. (p. 215).

""what makes Latium unique among city-state societies is the high degree of interaction and mobility among individual city states. shared rights and privileges included the ius conubii on marriage, the ius commercii on legally binding contracts, and the ius migrationis on citizenship in other city states."" (p. 220)
Significant horizontal mobility across city states but vertical immobility across classes.

""the standard features [of political institutions in the city states] were annual magistracies, elected by a popular assemby, and a senate or council of former office holders."" (p. 221)

Description of the case of self-governance in regards to punishment, where headmen came to a decision that got implemented collectively by both men and women in the community:
-	“I have known of but two or three instances where they have inflicted punishment, and on those occasions their mode was pretty rough one” (Swan, p. 53)
-	[more details of the case1] [ex stabbed the new husband in the back] “this was considered a gross outrage by the rest of the tribe; not the stabbing, but doing it without sufficient cause.” (Swan, p. 53)
-	“The head men deliberated, and at last gathering together a band of friends, they proceeded to the village where the culprit resided, and after first securing him, they pulled out his hair and sacrificed the top of his head.” (Swan, p. 53)
-	“The women finished the scene by pouring salt water on him, and rubbing his head with sand.” (Swan, p. 53)

A case of strict enforcement of punishment for being disrespectful during ceremonies: 
-	“The other instances were for offences committed during the tamanawas ceremonies, and the punishment consisted in having sharp skewers of bone thrust through the fleshy part of the arms between the elbows and shoulders.” (Swan, p. 53)
-	“After they had thus remained a short time, they were pulled out, and stuck in the bark head band, where they were obliged to be worn during the reminder of the ceremonies.” (Swan, p. 53)
-	“In some instances they close the mouth by thrusting these skewers through the lips.” (Swan, p. 53)
-	“This punishment is inflicted on those who laugh at or ridicule the ceremonies” (Swan, p. 53)

A description of punishment “In cases of theft, adultery, or murder..."", where it is upon parties involved to negotiate on further actions:
-	…an opportunity is always offered to compromise the affair by restitution of the stolen property; and by the payment of a certain amount of blankets, guns, or canoes for the other offences; the amount of such payment being decided by the friends of the plaintiff in the case” (Swan, p. 53)
-	“If no such compromise is made, the aggrieved party will take his revenge either on the person who has committed the offence, or on any of his relatives; this revenge will be satisfied by breaking up a valuable canoe, taking forcible possession of any blankets or guns that may be had; or, if the offence consists in murder, by shooting or stabbing the offender or his nearest relative.” (Swan, p. 53)

(Fathauer, p. 97) Mohave are frequently described as warlike, however, Stewart (p. 257) states that people as a whole were pacifically inclined. It was the existence of a distinct class of warriors (Kwanamis) with whom warfare was an obsession among the Mohave that resulted in the frequent warring expeditions. This warring class, just like any other official in Mohave, obtained their status and powers from the spirits in their dreams (Stewart, p. 257). Within a tribe, there were two or three Head Kwanamis who recruited and led the war parties that consisted of the Braves, Kwanamis, and common people (Stewart, p. 260, p. 266; Fathauer, p. 99). People were defined as common if they had not dreamed special powers (Fathauer, p. 99). Another official that accompanied the war party was the Scalper that acted as a Shaman and doctored the warriors (Stewart, p. 269). Scalper was the only one who had dreamed of powers that allowed him to scalp the enemy without being affected by his scalp's magical potency (Stewart, p. 269). 

At home, it was Kwaxot, the main tribal leader, who cared for these war trophies (Fathauer, p. 110). His main responsibility was to ensure tribal integration, which was achieved through his religious position (Fathauer, p. 109). Similarly, this position was obtained from the spirits in a powerful dream (Fathauer, p. 110). 

Decisions regards the tribal internal affairs were conducted through the Informal Council that consisted of Kwaxot and the male heads of each settlement (Fathauer, p. 109). Decisions regards war expeditions, which was a primal aspect of Mohave's external affairs, were conducted through the Conference for Warfare (Fathauer p. 98). There, Mohave's officials such as Kwaxot, Scalper, Head Kwanamis, Braves (Kwanamis) and spies solicited the opinions of some of the wise old men of the tribe (Fathauer p. 98). 

Women played a minor role as their dream was also considered weaker than those of other officials (Fathauer p. 109). Yakatha'alya women would partake in Scalper's ceremony and encourage men to join war parties through shaming (Fathauer p. 109). 

In addition, when Mohave were forced to interact with the Whites, a new official role came to be - Chief for dealing with White People (Fathauer p. 110). Even though, as discussed above, Mohave believed that it was up to spirits to choose the officials by appearing in the special dreams, this was not the case with the Chief for dealing with the Whites (Fathauer p. 109). The first Chief was selected because he was ""lucky"" in his dealings with the Whites, and this position carried on being hereditary (Fathauer p. 109).

","HETEROGENEITY
- There was social heterogeneity since ""Leading men"" such as tribal chieftains ""were usually regarded as nobles (Fletcher, p. 16)."" Also shamans, with their supernatural abilities, formed an intellectual social class. 
- Ethnic kinship groups were seen in terms of different clans, each of which had their own tribal chief. 
Heterogenous without political cleavages
- the Shamanic guild and Tribal council were institutions that created a balance of power between different social and ethnic groups respectively. Each chieftain was a member of the council and each shaman was associated with a guild. 
- Furthermore, shamans could also become chieftains, indicating that there were few social barriers to attaining political power - and hence there were no political cleavages based on social groups.

-	In the absence of written records (or a time machine), there are serious limits to what we can say about kinship and inheritance, or how people in these cities went about making collective decisions. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 294)
-	Still, some clues exist, beginning at the level of individual households. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 294)
-	Each of these had a roughly common plan, but each was also, in its own way, unique.
-	From one dwelling to the next there is constant innovation, even playfulness, in the rules of commensality. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 294)
-	Each family unit invented its own slight variations on domestic rituals, reflected in its unique assemblage of serving and eating vessels, painted with polychrome designs of often mesmerising intensity and made in a dazzling variety of forms. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 294)

-	Individual households would sometimes opt to cluster together in groups of between three and ten families. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 294)
-	Ditches or pits marked their boundaries. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 294)
-	At some sites these groups coalesce into neighbourhoods, radiating out from the centre to the perimeter of the city, and even forming larger residential districts or quarters. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 294)
-	Each had access to at least one assembly house, a structure larger than an ordinary dwelling where a wider sector of the population might gather periodically for activities we can only guess at. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 295)
---------------------------------------------------------

Nebelivka is a mega-site from the Cucuteni-Tripolye culture. A number of other mega-sites have also been documented. Maidanetske seems to be a recreation of Nebelivka's spatial structure a century or two later (there are perimeter boundaries and Assembly Houses creating a 'House -> Neighbourhood -> Quarter -> City' structure). Dobrovody has a similar number of Assembly Houses as Maidanetske, but is missing perimeter boundaries common to the structures of Nebelivka and Maidanetske. Taljanky, the largest mega-site, does not seem to have either of these features. 


-	By 4500 BC, chernozem was widely distributed between the Carpathian and the Ural Mountains, where a mosaic landscape of open prairie and woodland emerged capable of supporting dense human habitation. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 290)
-	The Neolithic people who settled there had travelled east from the lower reaches of the Danube, passing through the Carpathian Mountains. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	We do not know why, but we do know that – throughout their peregrinations in river valleys and mountain passes – they retained a cohesive social identity. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	Their villages, often small in scale, shared similar cultural practices, reflected in the forms taken by their dwellings, female figurines and ways of making and serving food. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	The archaeological name given to this particular ‘design for life’ is the Cucuteni-Tripolye culture, after the sites where it was first recorded. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)

-	So the Ukrainian and Moldovan mega-sites did not come out of thin air. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	They were the physical realisation of an extended community that already existed long before its constituent units coalesced into large settlements. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	Some tens of these settlements have now been documented. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	The biggest currently known – Taljanky – extends over an area of 300 hectares, outspanning the earliest phases of the city of Uruk in southern Mesopotamia. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	It presents no evidence of central administration or communal storage facilities. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	Nor have any government buildings, fortifications or monumental architecture been found.
-	There is no acropolis or civic centre. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)

- In the same two mega-sites with perimeter boundaries —Nebelivka and Maidanetske—a similar pattern of spatial division has been recognized based on four spatial levels—the house, the Neighbourhood, the Quarter, and the entire site (Chapman et al., 2014, 2014a; Ohlrau, 2014). (Chapman, p. 128)

- Turning to the later, Phase CI mega-sites, the basic Nebelivka spatial structure was re-created a century or two later at Maidanetske, with an estimated total of fifteen Assembly Houses and a maximum mean ratio of almost 200 houses per Quarter (Ohlrau, 2014). (Chapman, p. 129)
- A similar number of Assembly Houses is estimated for Dobrovody (Rassmann et al., 2014: 126). (Chapman, p. 129)
- It is even more intriguing, therefore, that only one possible Assembly House has been recognized at Taljanky— after all, the largest known mega-site in the Trypillia world. (Chapman, p. 129)
- The missing perimeter ditch and the absent Assembly Houses at Taljanky seem to us to be two sides of the same coin—an alternative social structure in which different ways of integrating a large population were used in contrast to those at Nebelivka and Maidanetske. (Chapman, p. 129)

- The presence of a perimeter boundary at two mega-sites—Nebelivka and Maidanetske—and their absence from the other two—Taljanky and Dobrovody—suggests major differences in social practices on these sites and the means that they used to integrate subgroups with(out) communal building projects. (Chapman, p. 129)
- The same is true for the absence from Taljanky of Assembly Houses, when these large structures were of such obvious social significance for the mega-sites of Nebelivka, Maidanetske, and Dobrovody. (Chapman, p. 129)

- This is not to say that all mega-structures, whether at Nebelivka or at other mega-sites, will produce identical excavated results. (Chapman, p. 129)
- Yet the first excavation of such a mega-structure has provided an intriguing combination of expanded scale and reduced object deposition. (Chapman, p. 129)
- Further post-excavation studies will doubtless enable us to add more texture and colour to this provocative initial sketch, which contributes another layer of interpretation to the debate on Trypillia ‘urbanism’. (Chapman, p. 129)
---------------------------------------------

Establishment of Nebelivka Quarters:

- Assembly houses were located at a variety of spacings around the outer and inner house circuits. (Chapman, p. 128)
- They occurred in varying combinations: six isolates, five pairs, two trios, and one area with no assembly houses at all. (Chapman, p. 128)
- We consider the location of assembly houses to be of critical importance for the spatial division of the outer and inner house circuits and inner radial streets into the second level of spatial order—the ‘Quarters’. (Chapman, p. 128)
- A critical question concerns the establishment of boundaries between the Nebelivka Quarters. (Chapman, p. 128)
Currently, eight criteria have been used to partition the mega-site into Quarters: (Chapman, p. 128)
(1) ‘Natural’ features, such as palaeo-channels (BUT there are only two palaeo-channels); 
(2) the border half-way between Assembly Houses (BUT this ignores local topographyphies); 
(3) the boundary between (pairs of) Assembly Houses (BUT sometimes there are three Assembly Houses or only one); 
(4) any large gaps between Neighbourhoods (BUT there is often a continuous spread of houses (e.g. E–F, F–G); 
(5) kinks in circuits (BUT these are absent in many parts of the circuit(s));
(6) major variations in the width of the middle (inter-circuit) space; 
(7) gaps in the ditch (BUT some one-third of the outer circuit has no surviving ditch); and 
(8) ‘Obvious’ entrances and passageways (BUT these gaps are not always obvious!).
----------------------------------------------
Assembly House technicalities:

- This mega-structure is currently the largest structure known from the Trypillia-Cucuteni group; the prima facie interpretation would be that such large buildings were some kind of ‘public’ building, performing integrative functions for several parts of the Nebelivka mega-site. (Chapman, p. 120)
- In summary, there were three final stages in the biography of the mega-structure: (Chapman, p. 125)
(1) the temporary or permanent cessation of social practices inside the building; 
(2) a period of as yet unknown duration allowing the build-up of thin levels of Chernozem derived soil layers within the mega-structure; perhaps the mega-structure was not used in this period; and 
(3) two stages of the collapse of the building to produce the ploshchadka.

Composed of banjar (hamlets, with a political function), subak (irrigation society). Each village republic had a representation in the pemaksan. 

Institutional mechanisms in the Banjar (hamlet)
- The krama banjar was composed of the citizenry of the hamlet. A man became a member of this after getting married or having his first child. This ensured that each family had a representative in it.
- The krama banjar met once every 35 days, but special meetings could be called. It made all the important policy decisions with consensus. 
- The krama banjar elected the kilan banjar, a set of leaders (the number of which varied from hamlet to hamlet). They were less like rulers and more like the agents of the krama banjar, since they were responsible for the execution of the decisions made by the krama banjar. There were no codified rules dictating their actions, but the kilan banjar followed its own mode of procedure based on past traditions.  
- The krama banjar was ""the sovereign body in all hamlet affairs, ·punishing any incorrigible resistance to its authority, no matter how apparently trivial, by ostracism"" Thus, the banjar enforced its decisions by criticising and shunning those who did not abide by its dictates.  

Institutional mechanisms in the subak (irrigation society)
- the boundaries between rice fields and the extent/usage rights of each irrigation canal were very clearly defined in the constitution (awig-awig subak), which pre-empted water disputes. 
- Structure and powers identical to the hamlet : it had a krama subak, kilan subak and a constitution (awig-awig subak). However, while the domain of the hamlet was political, that of the subak was economic, specifically, the irrigation of rice fields. 
- the members of krama subak (irrigation assembly) did not include representation from all the village, but only large landowners and those who irrigated their terraces from a shared water source, making it an elite assembly. 
- However, its authority and cultural importance was at par with the hamlet's : ""as in the hamlet, in the sphere of life where public rights and public interests were conceived to be dominant its word was law, defiance of its word crime.""

Relation of Pemaksan to the village republic
""Like the hamlet and the irrigation society, the pemaksan is corporate; like them, it is specifically directed toward certain limited, well defined ends; and, like them, it is essentially autonomous. Its political importance derives from its role as a spiritual group, as theirs derives from their role as a governmental or pro­ductive group."" (pg. 53)",19th century AD,1800,1900,"Asia Southeast, Bali",Unknown,"Geertz, Clifford, (1980) Negara: The Theatre-state in Nineteenth-century Bali","The exact number of hamlets, which were the essential unit of the village republic ranges widely (from hundreds to thousands according to Geertz). [this is why the size is unknown]

The organisation of the centralised powers in Negara Ubud is not backed by evidence of their actually being put into practise. The overarching system of the raja (king) with a kerajaan (kingdom) is an idealised and necessarily abstract model. Thus, Geertz refers to it ""as a conceptual entity not an historical one."" This is further bolstered by MacRae's argument that the Negara Ubud extended into the 21st century, since even after colonial powers took over, the functioning of the village republics and dadia remained unaltered.  

HETEROGENEITY
- There were separate representation mechanisms for the wealthier farmers in the irrigation society (subak) and for all the families in the village in the banjar. This shows that there was formal inclusion through different institutions. However, the word of the councils was adhered to by all the members of the community, indicating that there was no political cleavage.

- Informal inclusion and Systemic power imbalance for Gender groups 
Women were said to advise and support men, but “had no say in any matters of importance.” Women could also not be chiefs. 
Institutions only represented men and thus, while there is informal inclusion of women, men are evidently more powerful. 

- Informal inclusion and informal power balance for the group of more intelligent/wiser members. 
Experienced and wise men were consulted by the chiefs in an informal council. This was significant because it was this informal council that chose the war-chief. 
Furthermore, another way of informal (at least from a political point of view) inclusion of intelligent citizens was through the custom of having orators. They are described as “wise and wealthy,” and make speeches that have the power to influence public opinion. 
Therefore, informal inclusion leads to an informal power balance in favour of the wise and learned group of people within the community. ","Gender groups,Informal inclusion,Systemic power imbalance,Social groups,Informal power imbalance ",Edited may 23,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,North America,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,200

Badal may have adverse effect on the economy, as targets would rather hide from potential attackers than to tend to their fields.

Traders 'formed councils to assist the kings in the management of complexities of their cities, and consequently they gained some power' (p. 37)

'The Amarna Letters contain references to councils of elders, or magnates, with whom local kings consulted on important matters of the state and who could even frustrate a king’s will' (p. 38)

From later developments: 

'some Phoenician municipalities were ruled, from time to time, by sovereign assemblies with deliberative functions; and the participation of citizens, and thus democratic activity, is evident in the earliest period of the Phoenician city-states.' (p. 39)

The city of 'Tyre was ‘a republic headed by elective magistrates’ at this period (Bondi, 2001: 153).' (p. 40) [6th ce.]
- Governed by suffetes 

'There is a lack of evidence as to how broadly these institutions represented the populace and how free and unconstrained their deliberations were, but on balance it may be concluded, from the few occasions when the people are visible, that Byblos, Sidon and Tyre, at least, had something more than an autocracy or oligarchy and much closer to democracy.'

- Senate: 'a conservative body in which the oldest and most experienced men had a powerful influence' (p. 36)
- 'Decisions proposed by the Senate had to be confirmed by the third element of the Republican system, the popular assemblies' (Gwynn, David (2012), p. 33, EPUB version). Two main assemblies: Comitia Centuriata and Concilium Plebis
- Consuls: Two consuls in the senate. From 367 BC, even plebeians. 'The magistrates were the officials elected annually from the nobility to run the daily business of government. First and foremost were the two consuls who held the imperium (executive power) once wielded by the king. During their year in office, the consuls were the political and military heads of the state. They presided over the Senate, proposed laws if required, and commanded armies in the field.' (p. 30)
- Hierarchy: patricians and plebeians. Based on blood relations, i.e. only those from patrician families could hold office. Many plebeians owned as much wealth as some patricians.
- Opposition to pro-patrician institutions led to strikes by plebeians in early 4th ce. BC
- Inability to pay creditors led to enslavement
- Patricians allowed the plebeians to have the Concilium Plebis and the tribunes of the plebs, which provided a check on the patrician senate
- 'Eventually, plebeians gained access to almost all major political and religious offices. The distinction between patricians and plebeians by birth still existed, but the Republic’s ruling class had widened and a new aristocracy had emerged which contained both patrician and plebeian nobles. By the early 3rd century, this combined nobility was firmly established. So too were the three key elements that comprised the unique government structure of the Roman Republic: the magistrates, the Senate, and the popular assemblies.' (p. 30)
- 'Below the consuls were lesser magistrates, again elected annually. The major offices were those of praetor, aedile, quaestor, and tribune of the plebs. The praetor was the only magistrate apart from the consul to hold imperium, the right to command armies and preside over the Senate. The authority of the praetor was inferior to that of the consul, and the praetor’s main role was civil and later provincial jurisdiction. Below the praetors were the aediles, who were responsible for the urban maintenance of Rome, including roads, water supply, food, and games. The most junior magistrates were the quaestors, who performed financial and legal duties.' (p. 31)
- 'Ten tribunes were elected each year, and their intended role was to defend plebeians from unjust actions by patrician magistrates. For this reason the tribunes held considerable powers, including the right to intervene in support of a citizen being arrested by a magistrate, the right to veto the action of another magistrate, and the right to propose legislation in the Concilium Plebis. In theory the person of a tribune was sacrosanct, although this did not always protect those who used the office to pursue radical policies, most famously the Gracchi brothers in the 2nd century.' (p. 31)
- 'The other slightly unusual office was that of censor. Two censors were elected approximately every five years, but they held office only until they had completed their functions and never for longer than 18 months. Their primary role was to revise the list of citizens and assess both their property and their morality. This duty included a review of the Senate, into which they could enrol new members and remove any found guilty of improper behaviour.' (p. 31-2)
- 'A consul or praetor at the end of their year in office could be granted an extension of their imperium should the need arise. They then became pro-consuls and pro-praetors, although such extended authority became common only in the 1st century.' (p. 33)
- 'Early Rome had no written legal code. Questions of justice
were decided by customary unwritten law, preserved and
judged by the patricians' (p. 30). Later codified law (e.g. Twelve Tables (c. 450 BC), Lex Hortensia).
- Dictator: 'appointed with superior imperium to oversee the state. A dictator could hold office only for six months or for the duration of the emergency, whichever was shorter.' (p. 33)

- Culture: 
'Women played largely subordinate roles' (p. 35). They were reduced to household carers, priestesses and heroic archetypes which placed the value of family above one's own life (e.g. Lucretia)
'Dignitas' - the sum of individual's and his family's worth and renown. This determined his standing in the Senate. Best way to increase dignitas was through 'gloria' which was best gained in war. 

Regular plebeians were tied to the elite in a patron-client relationship. 'The patron offered protection and financial aid in return for the client’s labour and political support through votes and public displays. It was an informal rather than legal relationship and so was open to abuse, but such abuse was rare.' (p. 38-9)

Introduction of ""simple communes"":
-	""But down into the 16th century there continued to be a vast area, known as “black land”, where it [private landowning] had not yet been introduced."" (Blum, p. 93)
-	""Though quantitative data are lacking, it seems probable that the total extent of the black land exceeded that of privately owned."" (Blum, p. 93)
-	""The practice of turning over black land to private lords became increasingly frequent from the latter part of the 15th century on."" (Blum, p. 93)
-	""As a consequence, the great majority of the peasantry in the 16th century were renters of land that belonged to private proprietors of that was held by pomeshchiks on service tenure."" (Blum, p. 93)
-	""By the 17th century, landowners had broken up most of the old volost’ communes in the Central Non-Black Earth region."" (Moon, p. 201)
-	""They replaced them with smaller and weaker communes, which coincided with their estates."" (Moon, p. 201)
-	""In the 18th and 19th centuries, over ¾ of communes in the European part of Russia coincided with single villages."" (Moon, p. 201)
-	""They were known as “simple communes”.""
-	""There were smaller numbers “split” and “composite” communes."" (Moon, p. 201)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Administration (Institutions):
-	""Many landowners appointed managers (upravlyayushchie) and stewards or bailiffs (prikazshchiki) to administer their estates."" (Moon, p. 202)
-	""They worked with officials from the village communes."" (Moon, p. 202)
-	Communes on lands belonging to monasteries, the state or the court had similar officials. (Moon, p. 202)
-	The names, methods of appointment and duties of peasant functionaries varied from village to village. (Moon, p. 202)
-	In most villages, there was a headman (burmistr), a tax-collector (tseloval’nik) and a clerk (zemskii), who was sometimes a sacristan from the parish church. (Moon, p. 202)
-	Many villages also had elders (starosty), foremen (starshina) and selectmen (vybornye). (Moon, p. 202)
-	They were assisted by overseers (smotriteli) and constables (sotskie, pyatidesyatskie, desyatskie). (Moon, p. 202)
-	Most communes had a churchwardern (tserkovanyi starosta). (Moon, p. 202)
-	Peasant functionaries were either appointed by the landowner, sometimes with the approval of the communal assembly (skhod), or elected by the assembly and confirmed in office by the estate management. (Moon, p. 202)
-	Some peasant functionaries were paid by their landowners or were recompensated by having their seigniorial obligations reduced or waived. (Moon, p. 202)
-	Others received payment from their communes, which raised taxes from their members for this purpose. (Moon, p. 202)
-	More widespread were estates on which landowners (usually absentees) entrusted most administration to communes. (Moon, p. 202)
-	Communal officials ran the villages, and reported back to the landowners, who retained overall control but did not interfere in the internal life of villages. (Moon, p. 202)
-	Such landowners’ interests did not extent much beyond the receipt of the obligations they demanded. (Moon, p. 202)
-      On some estates, with the agreement of the landowner or estate authorities, communes were in charge of issuing passports to peasants who wanted to leave the village to work as migrant labourers. (Moon, p. 225)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Downfalls of this system:
Poor elections:
-	""… findings of a survey of state peasant villages made in the late 1830’s by government inspectors."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""They reported that commune meetings often degenerated into drinking bouts."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""At elections of mir officials the successful candidate frequently turned out to be the man who bought the most drinks for the voters."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""The rich peasants in the commune generally did not run for office themselves."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""Instead, they backed others who, when elected, repaid their wealthy supporters by special favours, such as reductions in the payment they had to make."" (Blum, p. 523)

Poor clergy:
-	""The clerk of the mir enjoyed much power and prestige, for often he was the only person in the commune who could read and write."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""Unfortunately, his learning was usually small and his palm easily crossed."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""As a result, in many communes the account books were in a state of confusion."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""That made it easier for dishonest officials to conceal their misuse or appropriation of mir’s assets."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""Sometimes these embezzlers stole just small amounts, but on occasion they gave full rein to their acquisitive instincts; the government inspectors discovered that in two communes in Vologda peculations amounted to 32,091 rubles."" (Blum, p. 524)

Excessive power of Proprietor:
-	""On privately owned land every act of the mir was subject to the review of the proprietor."" (Blum, p. 524)
-	""He could cancel any of its decisions, could replace elected officials with men of his own choosing, could command repartition of holdings or forbid it, and, indeed, could disband the commune itself."" (Blum, p. 524)
-	""But such actions were exceptional."" (Blum, p. 524)
-	""Normally the lord, even when he lived on his property and personally supervised its operation, allowed the mir much autonomy, conferred with its leaders before he introduced changes, and turned over to it much of the internal administration of the property."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The mir officials apportioned the obligations the seignior demanded among its members in proportion to the amount and quality of land they had, or to their other sources of income."" (Blum, p. 525)
---------------------------------------------------------------
State Land and the Rules for the Operation of Communes:
-	""On state land the government, in the first part of the nineteenth century, laid down a number of rules for the operation of communes."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""To begin with, it ordered the creation of mirs in every village of state peasants, though small settlements could choose to join the communes of neighbouring larger places."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The law ordered the land of the village to be held communally, and gave the mir the responsibility of dividing it among its members."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The commune could rent additional state-owned land for its own uses, and with official permission could buy and exchange land with private persons, or rent part of its own land to outsiders."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The periodic redistribution of communal land was the mir’s most important function."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The frequency of these repartitions fluctuated widely."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""Often they were carried out after each general revision. "" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""Some communes, however, made general redistributions at shorter intervals such as every six years, and even annual redistributions were not unknown."" (Blum, p. 525)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Starozhil’tsy vs Novoprikhodtsy vs Polovnik peasants:
Peasant were categorised as Starozhil’tsy (old inhabitants),  Novoprikhodtsy (newcomers) or Polovnik (sharecroppers)
-	Newcomers were excused from all or part of the obligations. (Blum, p. 98)
-	Peasant was a newcomer for a set period of time agreed between the landlord and the new peasant on his arrival. (Blum, p. 98)
-	It ran usually from 5 to 15 years. (Blum, p. 98)
-	Polovnik greed to remain with the lord for an agreed upon number of years and to pay a fixed proportion of his crop to the lord as rental. (Blum, p. 100)
-	On his arrival polovnik received a loan of cash or of grain from the landlord in order to get started on his farming, and to carry him over until he brought in his first crop. (Blum, p. 100)


------------------------------------------------------------
Size:
- In the early centuries of Russia's history the peasants whether black people or renters on privately owned land, lived usually in isolated farmsteads or in tiny hamlets. (Blum, p. 504)
- This pattern of settlement persisted well into the 16th century. (Blum, p. 504)
- Then peasants began to give up living in isolated farmsteads and came together into villages. (Blum, p. 504)
- (1850s) In terms of population rather than number of homesteads the most common settlement size was between 51 and 300 people. (Blum, p. 506)
Out of 100,299 settlements:
5.2%  (5,238) had fewer than 10 inhabitants
22.5% (22,456) had between 11 and 50
53% (53,077) had between 51 and 300
8.5% (8,593) had between 301 and 500
6.6% (6,651) had between 501 and 1,000
3.0% (3,030) had between 1,001 and 2,000
1.2% (1,254) had between 2,001 and 25,000

- Estimates of the total population of Russia at the end of the 16th century vary between 2.5-2.9 million and 11 million, but a figure of 7 million seems plausible. (Moon, p. 20)
- On 28 January 1897 the first, and only, general census of the population of the Russian Empire was held. (Moon, p. 11)
- The 1897 census: total population of 125.6 million. (Moon, p. 12)",16th-19th century AD,1500,1900,Europe East,"1,000,001 - 10,000,000","'- Moon, David, the Russian Peasantry 1600-1930: The World the Peasants Made, 1999.

'During the period from 1287 to 1355 Siena was controlled by an oligarchical regime in which the city’s merchants were particularly well represented. During the decades after 1355, the commune was instead controlled by a sequence of regimes, several of which had much heavier popular participation and none of which was characterized by the same degree of merchant control.' (p. 196)

'Siena gained its independence as a commune during the twelfth century. After this point, like Genoa, it had a consular regime followed by rule of a podesta. Ultimate political authority in Siena rested with the city council (the Council of the Bell), which existed from 1176, and which intervened in all types of issues faced by the commune. From 1287 to 1355, while ultimate legitimacy remained with the Council of the Bell, the affairs of the commune were controlled by a committee of nine magistrates who held the title of the Nine Governors and Defenders of the Sienese Commune. More commonly, these individuals were simply referred to as the Nine. The Nine was actually a body of officials each of whom served a two-month term.' (p. 196)

Major developments in the 16th and 17th centuries as city-states yield to cantons as primary political units. Entry based on the period of the cantons and focused on the ""rural"" cantons, where democratic and participatory forms predominated. 

Distinction between urban (aristocratic) and rural (democratic) cantons, but more in theory than in practice. On the one hand, democracy in rural cantons may have been captured by the elites (p. 193). On the other hand, for the urban cantons, Lau suggests that: ""The democratic heritage of Switzerland’s early modern cities has divided experts. The important decisions were made by a small elite (Goppold 2007). The towns were places where personal contacts were more important than the rituals of the assemblies, so, whatever the formal position, ordinary citizens hardly had a share in political power. Others emphasise the role of the cities in developing in new culture of public debate (p. 194).

Fargher et al. p. 231: ""We propose that the central element of cooperation in this polity consisted of a reciprocity between a governing council, which provided effective military leadership (and other public goods, such as market management and judicial services), and taxpayers, who produced surpluses and provided military service. Further, we hypothesize that taxpayer trust in the collectivity could be maintained by assuring that governing officials would follow the mandates of moral codes to demonstrate their commitment to the collective enterprise. Last, we propose that a comparatively egalitarian council-based system of governance would have had particular resonance with powerful groups among immigrants, in particular among the most important warriors who migrated into Tlaxcallan, the numerous Otomi.""

Elaborate systems used to select magistrates and officials including the doge. Other officials were plenty and with short term in office. ""Nomination committees for many posts were selected by ballot in the Great Council in a way that gave every person present an equal chance of being on a nomination committee. The conduct of all officials (including the Doge) was subject to scrutiny by committees to prevent unlawful gains."" p. 644

The powers of the doge were limited, so as not allow him to shift the balance of power. This was done by rules which also 'established tight administrative control over gains from interclan political cooperation, and allocated these rents among all the important Venetian clans fairly so all had a share in them regardless of clan affiliation.' (p. 644)

'Starting in 1032, the Doge’s authority was limited through the establishment of advisory councils until it was de facto altered from an elected monarchy to a republican magistracy. In 1172 it was established that a Doge should never act contrary to the advice of his councilors.' (p. 644)

'The conduct of all officials (including the Doge) was subject to scrutiny by committees to prevent unlawful gains.' (p. 644)

From Gonzales de lara et al. 2008:
'there were no formal constitutional rules limiting the doge's power. Once elected, the doge had absolute power with unlimited authority over all constitutional, administrative, political, and military matters. The factor that prevented doges from de facto assuming dictatorial powers was not the expectation of popular retaliation, as the coordination view might suggest. Rather, doges were constrained by a number of rival clans with relatively high administrative capacities.' (González de Lara (2008), p. 106)

'Various councils and magistracies were given overlapping jurisdictions, so that each was monitored by others. Office holders were legally required to notify the State Attorneys of any observed wrongdoings.'

Matriarchal control of Longhouses
""Each longhouse was run by a council of women."" Usually, the men did not have a council, but in the communities that they did, women councils ‘held veto power over any decision of the male council.’ (Graeber, 2022, p. 219). Thus, women controlled all the key stockpiles of clothing, tools and food in the longhouse. 

Matriarchal influence on the Confederacy council
""Senior women selected and unseated male representatives of their clan segments on the confederacy council."" (Birch, 2018, p.19) Furthermore, they had control over the domestic economy since they controlled the resources of the longhouses. Thus, they decided the ""provisioning of, or refusal to provision, war parties with maize and moccasins""
Lastly, ""women were responsible for arranging marriages, binding clans and communities together through networks of obligation"" Therefore, women were important in shaping confederacy politics, both directly and indirectly.
