Hxaro - System of mutual reciprocity

'Each family creates ties which distribute its risk over the population and thereby assure that losses will be covered in bad years.' (Wiessner (1982), p. 66)

'The hxaro relationship involves a balanced, delayed exchange of gifts, whose continuous flow gives both partners information about the underlying status of the relationship - one of a bond of a friendship accompanied by mutual reciprocity and access to resources. In addition, each partnership links a person to a broad network of hxaro paths' (Wiessner (1982), p. 66)

The business of the clan took place in an assembly where both young and old were present, and it must have included taxation. The clan elected a single chief—known as the raja—to run the assembly sessions and to preside over the business of state. Rhys Davids thought that the raja must have had a position like a Roman consul—a presiding officer but not truly a superior.' (p. 36)

'assembly of all householders' (p. 37)

'The largest and most influential Indian literary tradition, the Brahmanical, is distinctly hostile to anything resembling democracy.' (Muhlberger (1998), p. 3)
- 'Brahmanical literature gives kingship a central place in political life, and seldom hints that anything else is possible. For moral philosophers and legislators such as Manu (reputed author of the Manu-Smrti between 200 B.C.-A.D. 200), the king was a key figure in a social order based on caste (varna).' (p. 3)
- 'Caste divided society into functional classes: the Brahmans had magical powers and priestly duties, the ksatriyas were the rulers and warriors, the vaisyas cultivators, and the sudras the lowest part of society, subservient to the other three. Moral law or dharma depended on the observance of these divisions, and the king was the guarantor of dharma, and in particular the privileges of the Brahmans.' (p. 3)
- However, 'non-monarchical forms of government were omnipresent' (p. 6)

'it seems that in the northwestern part of India, republicanism was the norm.' (p. 7)
- 'But in many states, perhaps most, political participation was restricted to a subset of all the ksatriyas . One needed to be not just a warrior, but a member of a specific royal clan, the rajanya' (p. 8)
- 'The term raja, which in a monarchy certainly meant king, in a state with gana or sangha constitution could designate someone who held a share in sovereignty. In such places, it seems likely that political power was restricted to the heads of a restricted number of ""royal families"" (rajakulas) among the ruling clans. The heads of these families were consecrated as kings, and thereafter took part in deliberations of state.' (p. 8)

'In the Indian republics, as in the Greek poleis or the European cities of the High Middle Ages, economic expansion enabled new groups to take up arms and eventually demand a share in sovereignty36 If it was not granted, one could always form one's own mini-state.' (p. 9)

'In the case of the Buddhist sangha, the key organizational virtue was the full participation of all the monks in the ritual and disciplinary acts of their group.' (p. 11)

'Business could only be transacted legitimately in a full assembly, by a vote of all the members. If, for example, a candidate wanted the upasampada ordination, the question (ñatti) was put to the sangha by a learned and competent member, and the other members asked three times to indicate dissent. If there was none, the sangha was taken to be in agreement with the ñatti. The decision was finalized by the proclamation of the decision of the sangha.' (p. 11)

'In many cases, as in the granting of upasampada ordination, unanimity of full assembly was required' (p. 11)

If 'a dispute had degenerated into bitter and confused debate, it could be decided by majority vote, or referred to a jury or committee specially elected by the sangha to treat the matter at hand.' (p. 11)

'sovereign republics had a small, elected executive committee to manage the affairs of the gana when the whole membership of the gana was unable to be assembled.' (p. 12)
- 'the techniques seen in the Buddhist sangha reflect a sophisticated and widespread political culture based on the popular assembly. (p. 12)

'By the third and fourth centuries A.D., states known to be republics in earlier times were subject to hereditary executives. Eventually such republics became monarchies' (p. 15)

Culture:

'The Pali Canon, and to some extent the Jaina Canon, show us energetic movements that rejected the hierarchialism and caste ideology seen in the Vedas and Brahmanas in favor of more egalitarian values.' (p. 15)
- 'egalitarianism was an important element in the fifth century B.C' (p. 15)

'The title rājā has frequently been translated as king rather than chief. In many cases the later meaning of the term is applied to these early sources. Yet even in later periods the connotation of rājā has varied from landholder to king. The office of rājā in the Vedic sources was primarily that of a leader in battle and the protector of the settlements.' (Romila Thapar (1991), p. 36)

Vidatha - folk assembly/kin gathering

'Indo-European cognates for sabhā mean the assembly of the kinsfolk which would make its membership exclusive.167 In later periods the sabhā becomes an advisory body assisting the king.' (p. 57)

'Chiefdoms are characterized by a central leadership legitimized on the basis of
birth.' (p. 80)

'Genealogies, whether actual or fictionalized, are therefore of considerable
importance and ancestry becomes crucial.' (p. 80)

The heads of the rāja-kula families 'were eligible to sit in the Vriji assembly.' (p. 82)
- The assembly was most likely large due to the confederacy of eight clans
- One person was elected to preside over the assembly
IMPORTANT:
- 'Regularly assigned seats and a committee suggest a ranking within the gaṇa. A quorum was necessary and voting by proxy was permitted. The resolution before the gaṇa was moved, discussed, had three readings and was finally put to vote.' (p. 82)
- 'Later commentaries refer to an elaborate judicial procedure which sounds more ideal than actual, in which a case could move through six levels of appeal before coming to the president of the assembly as the final appeal.' (p. 82)

Some members (often young members) of the rāja-kula were exiled (e.g. during disputes) which at times led them to start their own settlements",1500-500 BCE (Vedic era),India,,"Stasavage, David (2020), The Decline and Rise of Democracy

- 7 Etruscan kings until the fall
- The Senate existed to advise the monarch

Republic
- Senate: 'a conservative body in which the oldest and most experienced men had a powerful influence' (p. 36)
- 'Decisions proposed by the Senate had to be confirmed by the third element of the Republican system, the popular assemblies' (Gwynn, David (2012), p. 33, EPUB version). Two main assemblies: Comitia Centuriata and Concilium Plebis
- Consuls: Two consuls in the senate. From 367 BC, even plebeians. 'The magistrates were the officials elected annually from the nobility to run the daily business of government. First and foremost were the two consuls who held the imperium (executive power) once wielded by the king. During their year in office, the consuls were the political and military heads of the state. They presided over the Senate, proposed laws if required, and commanded armies in the field.' (p. 30)
- Governors
- Hierarchy: patricians and plebeians. Based on blood relations, i.e. only those from patrician families could hold office. Many plebeians owned as much wealth as some patricians.
- Opposition to pro-patrician institutions led to strikes by plebeians in early 4th ce. BC
- Inability to pay creditors led to enslavement
- Patricians allowed the plebeians to have the Concilium Plebis and the tribunes of the plebs, which provided a check on the patrician senate
- 'Eventually, plebeians gained access to almost all major political and religious offices. The distinction between patricians and plebeians by birth still existed, but the Republic’s ruling class had widened and a new aristocracy had emerged which contained both patrician and plebeian nobles. By the early 3rd century, this combined nobility was firmly established. So too were the three key elements that comprised the unique government structure of the Roman Republic: the magistrates, the Senate, and the popular assemblies.' (p. 30)
- 'Below the consuls were lesser magistrates, again elected annually. The major offices were those of praetor, aedile, quaestor, and tribune of the plebs. The praetor was the only magistrate apart from the consul to hold imperium, the right to command armies and preside over the Senate. The authority of the praetor was inferior to that of the consul, and the praetor’s main role was civil and later provincial jurisdiction. Below the praetors were the aediles, who were responsible for the urban maintenance of Rome, including roads, water supply, food, and games. The most junior magistrates were the quaestors, who performed financial and legal duties.' (p. 31)
- 'Ten tribunes were elected each year, and their intended role was to defend plebeians from unjust actions by patrician magistrates. For this reason the tribunes held considerable powers, including the right to intervene in support of a citizen being arrested by a magistrate, the right to veto the action of another magistrate, and the right to propose legislation in the Concilium Plebis. In theory the person of a tribune was sacrosanct, although this did not always protect those who used the office to pursue radical policies, most famously the Gracchi brothers in the 2nd century.' (p. 31)
- 'The other slightly unusual office was that of censor. Two censors were elected approximately every five years, but they held office only until they had completed their functions and never for longer than 18 months. Their primary role was to revise the list of citizens and assess both their property and their morality. This duty included a review of the Senate, into which they could enrol new members and remove any found guilty of improper behaviour.' (p. 31-2)
- 'A consul or praetor at the end of their year in office could be granted an extension of their imperium should the need arise. They then became pro-consuls and pro-praetors, although such extended authority became common only in the 1st century.' (p. 33)
- 'Early Rome had no written legal code. Questions of justice
were decided by customary unwritten law, preserved and
judged by the patricians' (p. 30). Later codified law (e.g. Twelve Tables (c. 450 BC), Lex Hortensia).
- Dictator: 'appointed with superior imperium to oversee the state. A dictator could hold office only for six months or for the duration of the emergency, whichever was shorter.' (p. 33)

- Culture: 
'Women played largely subordinate roles' (p. 35). They were reduced to household carers, priestesses and heroic archetypes which placed the value of family above one's own life (e.g. Lucretia)
'Dignitas' - the sum of individual's and his family's worth and renown. This determined his standing in the Senate. Best way to increase dignitas was through 'gloria' which was best gained in war. 

Regular plebeians were tied to the elite in a patron-client relationship. 'The patron offered protection and financial aid in return for the client’s labour and political support through votes and public displays. It was an informal rather than legal relationship and so was open to abuse, but such abuse was rare.' (p. 38-9)

Empire
- Emperor: early title 'princeps'
- 'The Senate no longer held authority but endorsed Augustus’ requests, the annual magistrates were nominated by the princeps not elected by the assemblies, and the army answered to the emperor who represented the state. By Augustus’ death in AD 14 imperial rule was firmly established and the Republic had given way to the Empire.'

Principles of the first-possession principle were seen as fair

According to McDonnel, 'miners operated behind a Rawlsian ‘‘veil of ignorance,’’ visualizing themselves as claim-jumpers as easily as claim protectors (2002, pp. 5–7, 23–31).' (p. 162)

'Enforcement problems were especially severe for foreigners' (p. 169)

'Both customary usage and district rules struck a balance between the rights of claimholders and the rights of searchers.' (p. 168)
- Insecure property rights in mining claims

First-possession principle - Securement of property rights 'by marking and working a claim ahead of everyone else.' (p. 156)
- Led to 'claim jumping', which was seen as 'a common of beginning work on a mining site.' (p. 157)
- 'Any slacking of effort on the miners part exposed him to charges of having abandoned the claim.' (p. 162)
- 'Prior occupation was not sufficient to repossess a claim: the plaintiff also had to demonstrate that he had in fact complied with district work rules. Otherwise, the claim was liable to be ‘‘jumped,’’ a standard procedure for entry into gold mining, one which was legitimated by the mining codes.' (p. 162)

Mining district codes 
- '‘‘laws of the land’’ for a specified area, rules, and procedures binding on all miners in that district, founding members and newcomers alike.' (p. 160)

Lack of third-party enforcement
- 'Thus, miners often had to fight or risk losing their claims.' (p. 168)
- The instability led to a higher need for lawyers to solve disputes

Later on there was a kind of representative body that was able to enforce its will in certain issues, for instance regarding the appointment of military leaders, but there was probably no democratic governance with voting rights for the population.' (p. 14)

'The priesthood in Carthage was reserved for males of the aristocracy and was hereditary. The chief of the priests or rab kohanim, besides his important religious role, also exercised great influence over the workings of the State and economic life' (p. 41)

'Although the monarchy was certainly not hereditary, the most important positions were reserved for the members of certain families, which had the effect of creating dynasties.' (p. 42)

In the 4th ce. BC, Carthage became an aristocratic republic with a king, the 'Council of Elders' (similar to the Roman senate), the 'Tribunal of 104', and the 'ham', a parliamentary assembly

The Tshiluba speakers of Kasai—a region in the southern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo today—established a system of governance called a lwaba. Under this system of republican government one “big man” was elected by his peers as chief for a two or three-year term. In exchange for this he was expected to pay his peers a substantial sum' (p. 43)

'the Songye people, also of Kasai, established an “aristocratic republic” based on the eata system. The population was divided into two classes. Those in the upper class elected a president for a period of three to five years' (p. 43)

Even in hereditary societies, there were democratic institutions (e.g. Kuba kingdom)

Village societies (700-1000)
- Corporate matrilineages
- Dispersed matriclans
- 'In these regions, only descent through the mother’s line was used to establish corporate lineages, usually headed by the oldest man of the group and not by the oldest woman. He was succeeded by the next man in the uterine line.' (Vansina, Jan (2004), p. 88)
- 'monocephalic chiefdom as happened among the agropastoralists of the south. This was also the choice made in the regions of middle Angola.' (p. 163)
- 'chiefdoms preceded the creation of principalities or kingdoms.' (p. 163)
- 'Chiefdoms were formed when a single leader succeeded in obtaining the allegiance of several villages.' (p. 163); the new institution termed 'soba' in middle Angola
- 'Apparently the ﬁrst chiefs gained authority thanks to their skill in resolving disputes between communities.' (p. 163)
- 'At ﬁrst the role of chief may have been bestowed more or less temporarily on a person by the consensus of local leaders, but eventually that role came to be permanently vested in a single person.' (p. 165)
- 'The ethnographic data suggest that the succession to chieftaincy in these regions became both hereditary and elective because the local village and kingroup leaders chose one individual among the potential heirs.' (p. 165)

Culture:

'everyone believed that chiefs controlled rainfall, and hence the fertility of their lands, because of their supernatural powers. For that reason, they presided over ﬁrst sowing and/or ﬁrst-fruit rituals.' (p. 167)
- Chiefdom was a sacralised office which involved an initiation at the start

'Hunters, masters of metalworking, and diviners' had 'independent powerbases and could sometimes rival the chiefs' (p. 168)

With the growth of the kingdom came bureaucratic specialisation

Sometimes, chiefdoms formed alliances for better protections, which at times led to the integration of both communities under one ruler

'the whole kingdom certainly included well over 100,000 people and perhaps double that number compared to a 1,000 or so for a small early chiefdom.' (p. 189)

Rulers had the blessing of the ancestors and the spirits. Later lords also derived their right to rule from charms of office 'that granted political power to whomever held it.' (p. 190)

'The foremost titleholders at court were the “mani” ndongo, the foremost ritual authority at the capital, the viceroy or tandala, who acted as magistrate as well as a general and the ngolambole, a general in charge of war in the countryside and probably in charge of all territorial aﬀairs.' (p. 195)

'The larger villages were, of necessity, governed by a council of the heads of the several resident matrilineages meeting in a men’s clubhouse. There they debated, decided about common activities, and resolved (-sompa) whatever conﬂicts arose among themselves.' (p. 224)

'Various rites of passage that created sodalities, brought initiates from the constituent villages together, fostered their feelings of solidarity, and created ubwambu or kasendo friendship between their inhabitants.' (p. 224)

'A vicinage could easily be ruled informally by convening a council of their mwa(n)ta when necessary, and such a procedure was common in at least one corner of the region. Nothing more was needed. Yet eventually most vicinages came to be represented by a single individual, a person chosen because of his or her perceived wisdom in palaver debates, since as was the case farther west, here too such people were referred to as ngána 1/2 “wise ones.”' (p. 224)

'Having a common representative then helped to cement a feeling of solidarity among the villages of the vicinity. It was also quite practical whenever disputes between diﬀerent vicinages had to be settled.' (p. 224)

'The villagers were organized in several local matrilineages per village called édzungú 5/6, “cooking pot,” each of which was subdivided into households or tiny sublineages called edjiku 5/6, “hearth.” In turn, the édzungú themselves were equal members of a wider network of dispersed matriclans.' (p. 228)

'the whole village also formed a “House,” called shoóto 7/8, “ﬁreplace.” Such a House consisted of a single group composed of a set of related extended bilateral families whose “fathers” recognized a single overall “father” or big man. Well after these institutions had matured, the local languages then borrowed the word kalamba 12/13 from the adjacent region to the south to designate such big men.' (p. 229)

'He was therefore the de facto leader of the village, or at least a primus inter pares. He had direct control over all the marriages of the girls of his settlement, which is an indication of the ﬁerce competition for members between big men and their respective Houses or villages.' (p. 230)

'The vicinage was ruled collectively from a designated special place by representatives of those matrilineages thought to have ﬁrst settled on the land and to which the leaders of each House in the vicinage belonged. Both the grouping of such founding lineages and the place of their meeting were called ekuluwandá 9/6 , an expression which contains the notion of ngandá 9/10, a notion that designated all the inhabitants of the vicinage and is best translated as “society.”' (p. 230)

'Ekuluwandá, then, is the “place of the elders of the society.” This collective government was exercised on behalf of all the constituent settlements and of all age-related initiation groups. It was expressed through the performances of the sodality called ngongo munene or “great territory.” This sodality included three or four ranked levels complete with a hierarchy of masks marked in diﬀerent ways to indicate their rank. Induction into the initial rank of the association was voluntary, collective, and open to all adult men. Accession to higher ranks was, in part, hereditary in that it had to be patriﬁlial but descent was not enough. Candidates had to have the approval of the members of the rank they wanted to join, and they had to pay a hefty entrance fee.' (p. 231)

'Government was exercised by members of the highest rank of the ngongo munene. These were the mutúmbú 3/4 who decreed the necessary measures for all collective endeavors from organizing collective hunts to initiations, war, and the adjudication of all court cases.' (p. 231)

'The female equivalent of the ngongo munene exercised authority over women with regard to issues concerning them, but data are sorely lacking concerning their ruling organization.' (p. 232)

'in the late nineteenth century and undoubtedly also in earlier times, details of its institutions diﬀered from district to district. In some places, there were four ranks of the governing association and in others only three; in some places, such as among the Sala Mpasu, individual big men held more power than the ruling sodality, while in other places the balance of power tilted in favor of the sodality, as among the Kongo-Dinga.' (p. 233)
- 'Still, in essence, it remained the same system: everywhere society was structured by a hierarchy of age-sets and governed collectively by an oligarchy.' (p. 233)

'While people in the northeast of the region developed collective governance, their neighbors to the west took a slightly diﬀerent path by choosing to strengthen the authority of individual leaders in villages and vicinages without enlarging the scale of governance much beyond that of a vicinage.' (p. 234)

'Frictions between villages, especially within the same vicinage, were settled by arbitration through common palavers in a thoroughly decentralized manner. In these assemblies, “speakers” (ngambi 9/10) for each matrilineage set out their positions, and decisions were reached by a consensus of the whole audience.' (p. 237)
- 'Ngambi were “big men.” They were chosen within each lineage for their wealth plus oratory talent and they enjoyed a status marked by special privileges and customs. 88 They also formed a sort of club or guild that transcended individual vicinages.

Broad and frequent participation across the polis which included all free males
- However, a slave society which didn't include women in politics

'In the new Greek states that emerged after the Bronze Age collapse, rulers lacked bureaucracies, and they instead found themselves obliged to rule through consultation.' (p. 31)
- Meetings (agorai)

In the early years of Athens, an executive was chosen from aristocrats, 'nine archons who served one-year terms, as well as a council, known as the areopagus, composed of those who had previously served as archons.' (p. 32)

Later Solon created the boule, a council which was to rival the aeropagus and created the ekklesia, a large assembly of citizens. Here, all adult males could participate but the boule was still open to the wealthy only.

'Cleisthenes reorganized Athens into 139 demes—units of 150 to 250 individuals. In addition to belonging to a deme, citizens were associated with one of ten new artificially created “tribes” that now each sent 50 individuals, selected by lot, to a Council of 500 that would administer the day-to-day affairs of the city.' (p. 32)

From 462 BCE, even the lower classes, thetes, could hold office

'The Greek city-states for the most part failed to establish command-and-control bureaucracies. Nor did the Greek world develop an integrated master social or theological narrative that would have provided ideological support for the necessity of individual obedience to central authority' (Ober, Josiah (2015), p. 60)

'quasi-federal institutional reforms in the aftermath of a democratic revolution (ch. 7). Federalism was widely adopted in mainland Greece in the fourth century BCE (ch. 9). Federalist and quasi-federalist institutional experiments allowed Greek states to operate as extensive “networks of social networks”—and thereby contributed to solving the problem of monitoring and punishing free riders.' (p. 68)

Community rewards to those 'who lead efforts to punish malefactors.' (p. 68)

'Under Cleisthenes’ reformed constitutional order, 139 villages, towns, and neighborhoods of Attica were designated “demes.” An average deme had a free adult male population of 150– ­250, although some were smaller, and others, notably Aphidna and Acharnai, much larger.' (Ober, Josiah (2015), p. 162)

'Each Athenian was thus treated as a citizen at different levels: locally in his deme and at the federal level of the polis. All free adult males resident in Attica in the year of the reform were, in the immediate aftermath of the revolution, considered to be citizens of Athens and of their deme of residence. Moreover, the deme would hereafter be the fundamental unit of Athenian citizenship: To be a citizen of Athens, a male resident of Attica must be formally recognized by an assembly of citizens in his deme as having been born to an Athenian father who was himself a citizen of the deme, and as being at least 18 years of age.' (p. 162-4)

'Two intermediate levels of belonging connected the demes to the federal state. Citizens of each deme were assigned to one of ten newly created artificial “tribes.” Each tribe enrolled roughly a tenth of the citizens, drawn from three distinct regions of Attica.' (p. 164)

'Perhaps most importantly, the membership of the new central state Council of 500, which conducted Athens’ day-­ to-­ day public affairs and set the agenda for the legislative citizen assembly, was recruited through the new deme/tribe system. In later years, at least, councilors were aged 30 and older, were chosen by lot, and were paid for their service. Each of the 10 tribes annually provided 50 councilors. The members of each tribal contingent of 50 were chosen at the deme level, each deme sending a certain number of councilors according to population.' (p. 164)

'But Cleisthenes had not introduced to Athens what we think of today as “representative government” because councilors were not expected to represent the particularistic interests of their deme, regional third, or tribe. Nor were they accountable to local voters. Rather, the councilors served, collectively, as a microcosm of the Athenian citizenry. They represented what, in the aggregate, the Athenian people knew and the skills and information the Athenians could bring to bear on problems confronting the state.' (p. 164)

Areopagus
- 'membership was drawn from ex-­magistrates' (p. 166)

'The Athenian citizenry elected their military leaders; many other state officials were, however, chosen by lottery. All officials, elected or lotteried, were subject to ex ante public scrutiny and held publicly accountable, on an annual basis, for their performance.' (p. 168)

'Each year, the Athenian assembly decided whether to conduct an ostracism; if the decision was positive (as it was only 15 recorded times in Athenian history), the citizenry chose, by plurality written ballot, which prominent member of the Athenian elite to expel from the community for 10 years.' (p. 168)

The Council met almost daily, whilst the Assembly met four times each month

'The Solonian people’s court was subdivided into a number of courts, so that many more cases could now be judged by panels of citizens, chosen by lottery.' (p. 168)

'Federalism enabled trust among citizens, arising from local interactions at the deme level, to be leveraged at the level of the tribe and then at the level of the polis.' (p. 170)

'The deme-­tribe-­polis federal system helped to make the mass meetings of the Athenian assembly both less daunting and less clientalistic, as ordinary citizens developed social networks that extended at least to the tribe level.' (p. 171)

'Athenian citizens proved to be quite good at identifying and attending to experts and quite capable of using the knowledge of experts for the ends of policy-­ making without turning state management over to them.'

'this selection mechanism ensured that control of the council remained with a small number of influential families' (p. 171)

The distribution of landholding within a village involved collective choice arrangements. 
The land in the village was converted into shares, or 'subsections comprising fields of equal productivity' by 'universal agreement' or consensus amongst them. 
'The number of shares in a village was generally determined by the families in the village.' (p. 446) 
These shares could then be bought, sold, leased and divided fractionally. For fractional shares, groups forming one share could elect a representative to 'draw lots on behalf of the jointly held share.' 
Following this, 'the members of the group subdivided among themselves the plots allocated to that share during the lottery.' (p. 447)

Culture
Though figures of authority lacked physical force to enforce their decisions, the long tradition of the 'filial relationship' wherein the samurai/daimyo/shogun was considered a father-figure, meant that there was a 'habit of deference to and respect for superiors.'  Thus, 'The daimyo might not actually govern, but the men who did govern did not try to displace him or undercut his prestige' (p.10) This indicates strong patterns of loyalty

","There were around 27 provinces, controlled by either a shogun or a daimyo. Within a province, there were several villages. It is difficult to estimate the exact number of villages since the provinces were divided according to the amount of rice they produced and not the number of villages or the population. However, it can be roughly estimated that there were around 360 villages in each province based on its agricultural output. Each village had a council, which organised the corporate landholding process, as well as an assembly of all the citizens which voted on the distribution. 

Heredity/blood relations are not included as a mechanism since inheritance of political positions was frequent but by no means a rule of thumb.

'Village courts often dodge the limits of jurisdiction by hearing serious crimes and mediating until the opposing parties reach a settlement. Enga communities have taken the initiative to create a lower echelon of courts that fall outside of the national justice system: wari (worry) courts. One or two community leaders mediate disputes on the spot in wari courts (22); if mediation fails, complaints are taken to village courts.' (Wiessner, Pupu (2012), p. 1652)

Regular conflicts between clans with mercenaries (Rambos)

Rivalry between clans, mercenaries, politicians

'Christian values or human rights principles were not explicitly cited to justify decisions; magistrates did cite women’s rights, a prominent theme in the current media.' (p. 1653)

'Traditionally Enga society was, and to some extent still is, governed by a “bigman” system. All men started as equals and strove to make a name through producing pigs, excelling in mediation, organizing ceremonial exchange, negotiating peace and assisting their followers. Potential equality within the sexes was of utmost importance for internal cooperation.' (Wiessner (2010), p. 3)

'Men formed coalitions of supporters to rise in status, but if they failed to deliver benefits to their followers, their demise was rapid. Today a new rung of modern leaders has been added: politicians, public servants and businessmen. All modern leaders participate in traditional clan activities and contribute generously to wealth distributions.' (p. 3)

-	Collectively arranged marriages
-	‘The Papua New Guinea justice system is one of legal pluralism composed of formal national and district courts and customary courts (village courts)’
-	‘The formal courts were imposed by colonial powers with written laws based on Western legal systems, procedures, courtrooms, strict rules of evidence, police, fines and prisons. They are not widely used outside of towns because most people want disputes to be mediated in open public forums and solutions to be based on restorative measures. Moreover, the requirements of formal courts for strict rules of evidence can rarely be met, witnesses are often afraid to testify and lawyers are expensive’ (6)
-	‘In 1984, the government sanctioned customary courts as part of the plural Papua New Guinea justice system. They were crafted from traditional dispute management based on kastom (custom) to mediate and correct minor wrongdoings such as marriage disputes, theft, property damage and assault, but not serious crimes such as murder, rape or arson.’ (6-7)
-	‘Village courts apply local ‘custom’ to settle disputes and achieve justice through compensation for harm done which satisfies communities, promotes harmony and restores the reputation and cooperation of wrongdoers. Custom was imprecisely defined and kept flexible to accommodate the many cultures of Papua New Guinea. There are two levels of customary courts in Enga, local village courts (VCs) and Operation Mekim Save (OMS), a branch of village courts unique to Enga established in the 1980s in each district to settle inter-clan disputes, control tribal warfare and keep the peace’ (7)
-	‘There are currently 153 VCs in Enga. Each serves one to four clans, 600–2000 people, who are usually from the same tribe; this grouping is what I will call ‘community’. Community members from different clans under one VC are densely linked through marriage ties and share church and government facilities. Village courts are presided over by panels of five or more magistrates, usually highly respected semi-literate male local leaders, and in the last decade, female leaders as well. Open air court hearings are held at central points in Enga villages two afternoons a week; Wabag OMS hearings are held outdoors in the provincial capital almost daily as they cover the entire district. Magistrates work tirelessly to keep the peace for very minimal salaries but they gain considerable status and respect for their work.’ (7)
-	‘After the missions and the colonial administration were established in the 1950s and 1960s, bachelors’ cults and residential arrangements separating the sexes were dismantled within a span of two to three decades in central Enga.’ (13)

(Nitze Pupu and Polly Wiessner, The Challenges of Village Courts and Operation Mekim Save among the Enga of Papua New Guinea Today: A View from the Inside (2018))

o	‘The justice system of Papua New Guinea (PNG) is one of legal pluralism. It is composed of formal and customary court systems, with the former forged from western laws imposed by colonial powers and the latter from traditional dispute management based on kastom (custom).’ (1)
o	‘Punishments for crimes in the form of prison sentences and fines are imposed by the district and national courts on the premise that these will act as deterrents’ (1)
o	‘Customary law is based on the values and practices that indigenous Papua New Guineans used to settle disputes and maintain harmony long before first contact with Europeans’ (1)
o	‘The reasons for the establishment of customary law included the desire to return power to the people through drawing on community structure, to eliminate the injustices imposed by an imported law system that was foreign to local cultures, and to accommodate the great variation in norms, values, practices and sense of justice between the 800 or more linguistic groups in PNG’ (1)
o	‘The systems of formal and customary law were not, and still are not, well articulated’ (1)
o	‘In 1974, the Village Court Act of 1973 came into practice to serve parochial judicial needs by harnessing the skills and knowledge of leaders and mobilising the force of public opinion in village courts for disputes and minor wrongdoings, such as theft, customary marriage, property damage and unpaid personal debts. Serious crimes like rape, murder and arson that fall within the Criminal Code were outside the jurisdiction of village courts; limits were placed on amounts of compensation ordered and fines imposed by village courts. Village courts were to apply local ‘custom’ to settle disputes and achieve ‘substantial justice’ — justice that satisfies communities (Goddard 2009; Gordon and Meggitt 1985). Custom was imprecisely defined and kept flexible in order to prioritise community harmony.’ (1)
o	‘Customary law was distinguished from the formal law applied in district and national courts by placing emphasis on process instead of a set of rules’ (1)
o	‘Processes to restore relations and achieve harmony involved the following: mediation to reach consensus, popular participation, acceptance of a wide variety of evidence, and the consideration of the history and relationships between parties. Such restorative justice is an inclusive participatory approach (Dinnen 2003) in which stakeholders engaged in a conflict have the opportunity to tell their stories and express their opinions in an atmosphere of respectful listening (Braithwaite 2003).’ (1-2)
o	‘The outcome of the mediation is usually compensation rather than punishment; further exchanges often occur at or around the payment of compensation to renew ties.’ (2)
o	‘Village courts together with Operation Mekim Save (OMS), the division established in Enga in 1982 for handling inter-clan conflicts and tribal fighting, are widely used and very successful. It is probably fair to say that village courts and OMS hold the reins of peace in Enga Province today.’ (2)
o	‘Among the Enga, magistrates have been respected community leaders who acquired customary knowledge in men’s houses, in Sangai and Sandalu bachelors’ ceremonies and through attending marriage ceremonies, tee (moka) exchanges and many other events.’ (2)
o	‘Male children generally inherited land from their fathers or uncles; children belonged to their father’s clan, though inheritance practices varied within the Enga. Land was distributed between families within a sub-clan according to need.’ (2)
o	‘Sanctions were strong against those who did not keep trouble off their land.’ (2)
o	‘All groups have village courts administered by the Enga Provincial Government with access to OMS courts in their respective districts. There are currently 153 village courts in Enga and 10 OMS courts.’ (3)
o	‘People have four options to settle disputes: wari courts, village courts, Operation Mekim Save and formal courts.’ (3)
o	‘Wari (worry) courts fall outside the state’s legal system. One or two village court magistrates or other local leaders are paid equal, small sums of money to hear the dispute and mediate a settlement’ (3)
o	‘If the complaints are serious and the disagreement persists, they are brought to village courts, OMS or district courts.’ (3)
o	‘In the customary law system people can take complaints to village courts or OMS. Village courts stay within their jurisdiction (Table 1) and are effective in solving a range of disputes and minor crimes’ (3)
o	‘Serious complaints that the disputants do not want to take to formal courts are brought to OMS’ (3)
o	‘For tribal fighting, a panel of five or more experienced OMS magistrates hears the case, usually several times, until the warring parties agree on a settlement regarding the sum that both parties must pay. They then issue a settlement order. For serious crimes outside of tribal fighting, OMS magistrates inform both parties that the wrongdoing is beyond their jurisdiction and should be taken to formal courts. If the parties refuse, an OMS panel from the district hears the case, mediates and negotiates until both parties reach an agreement. During mediation, frustration and anger are vented; tempers gradually cool to the point where reconciliation is possible. Compensation agreements are recorded. The actual payment of compensation is voluntary; OMS neither follows up to ensure whether the agreements are upheld nor do they enforce them.’ (3)
o	‘Today, some clans are willing to turn heinous or repeat offenders over to the police to take them out of circulation and put an immediate stop to the violence. If the district court orders a jail sentence, compensation might also be mediated through OMS to satisfy communities that justice has been served.’ (4)
o	State-sanctioned land mediators
o	‘If mediation was unsuccessful, the dispute was forwarded to the local land court that was supposed to arbitrate, emphasising mediation, compromise and community consensus, even though the courts often took adversarial and adjudicative approaches.’ (5)
o	‘individualism is on the rise’ (5)

'In both seigneuries, the litigation usually started with a requeste (petition) submitted by someone, a single individual or, more frequently toward the end of the eighteenth century, a group of people.367 The greffier (clerk) wrote down the demand and the judge then scheduled an audience with the parties by sending a sergeant to deliver the exploit d’assignation (summons) demanding their presence before the court. On the day of the hearing, both parties were given the opportunity to defend themselves before the judge, the greffier and the procureur fiscal. The procureur fiscal (prosecutor) represented the interests of the seigneur. Both parties did use the service of lawyers, called procureurs.368 These lawyers gave advice to the parties, came to court with them on the day of the hearing, and wrote all procedurally pertinent documents. They also pleaded for their clients, using very technical language at times. Each party was allowed to respond to the claims of the other.'

Executions, imprisonment, even floggings, are allowed to no one other than the priests, and are not carried out as a punishment or on the orders of the commander, but as it were at the behest of the deity whom they believe to be present as they wage war.

Then the king or the chiefs are heard, in accordance with each one's age, nobility, military distinction, or eloquence. The power of persuasion counts for more than the right to give orders. If a proposal displeases them, they shout out their dissent. If they approve, they clash their spears. Showing approval with weapons is the most honourable way to express assent.' (p. 43)

'One may also bring in an accusation in the assembly, including a capital charge. The penalty varies according to the crime. Traitors and deserters are hanged on trees. Cowards, those who will not fight, and those who have defiled their bodies, are plunged into a boggy mire, with a wicker hurdle pressed on top of them. The difference in penalty is evidently according to the principle that, in general, crimes should be punished in public, to make an example of them, but that deeds of shame should be hidden away. There are also proportionate penalties for less serious offences. Those convicted are fined a certain number of horses or cattle, of which part is paid to the king or the state, part to the victim of the crime or his relatives.' (p. 43-4)

o	‘The 7,500,000 Igbo who live east of the Niger River traditionally had what Afigbo calls a “democratic village republic” system of political organization, with authority widely dispersed in autonomous units.’ (47)
o	‘The remaining 500,000 Igbo on the western side of the Niger and in the riverine towns of Onitsha and Ossomali, heavily influenced by the kingdom of Benin to the north, developed what Afigbo calls a “constitutional village monarchy” system.’ (47)
o	‘In both types of systems the units were small, and political authority was widely dispersed along the following lines: between the sexes; among lineages and kinship institutions; by age grades; among secret and title societies; and among oracles, diviners, and other professional groups. There was no clear separation between judicial, executive, and legislative functions, and no distinction between the political and the religious in the governmental process. Both systems were what we characterized earlier as dual-sex systems: each sex generally managed its own affairs and had its own kinship institutions, age grades, and secret and title societies.’ (47)
o	The Omu did not derive her status from any linkage to the king (e.g. through power heritage or marriage). She wasn't a queen in the Western sense
o	‘In addition to the omu, her councillors, and the ikporo ani, who represented the entire women’s constituency, there were other women’s political institutions in the traditional Igbo system that function on a small base. Among these were the umuada and the inyemedi, which operated at the village or lineage level. Since Igbo society was exogamous and patrilocal, a woman had to leave her natal village when she married. To deal with the dislocations of this system and insure a simulated lineage structure for married women, a system of reciprocal ties was built up between a woman’s two villages – the one in which she was born and the one into which she married. Women thus came to have two homes. In their natal village they were umuada, or daughters of the lineage and/or village; in the village of their marriage they were inyemedi (co-wives), i.e., co-wives of the village or lineage. In both they formed themselves into an out (organization), thus giving rise to otu umuada and out inyemedi.’ (51-52)",Pre-Colonial  ,Mid-western Nigeria,1 million - 10 million members,"Peggy Sanday, Female Power and Male Dominance (1981)

(p. 74)

'Leadership also tightly controlled contract negotiations. Traditionally, bargaining is relatively secret and closed. It was not until 1988 that members could reject a contract and authorize a strike with a simple majority rather than the two-thirds vote rule that had long been in place' (p. 74)

'The Teamsters have stood accused of at least three kinds of corruption. First was the accusation of labor racketeering, resulting in restraint of trade and intimidation of employers. In many instances, this involved legal practices, and the charge was laid by those opposed to the growing power of the IBT (Witwer 2000, 2003). In other cases, it became a second kind of corruption, in which the Teamsters paid off the police and local officials or allied themselves with mobsters. Some Teamster leadership and, in particular Jimmy Hoffa, have a documented past connection with organized crime.' (p. 75)
- 'Finally, there is a third kind of corruption, the larceny that lines the pocket of a union official. There is also documentation of this within the IBT. Dave Beck was the poster boy here. Interestingly, illegal corruption seems to have been largely tolerated by members unless it was at their expense.

Ex-presidents Beck and Hoffa 'were perfectly willing to punish, expel, or worse those who did not toe their line.' (p. 78)

Under Beck, there were mechanisms for rank and file members to replace leadership

'He also used trusteeship to advantage. Beck would allow the
rank and file to choose their leadership and then personally judge its performance based on the union’s growth and delivery. If the
leadership was unsuccessful according to Beck’s standards, he would put the local under trusteeship, giving a position of virtual
dictatorship to a trustee' (p. 79)

o	‘The Confederation made it possible for the Iroquois peoples to remain sovereign over their vast territories until the end of the eighteenth century.’ (305)
o	‘For all three of these peoples, the deep-seated cultural changes were not confined to ending the priestly-elite; they also led to a new form of government that fundamentally ended hierarchical, male-dominated, hereditary privileges. This was the basis on which the Iroquois created their brilliant Constitution and celebrated Confederation—which is excellent evidence of a great, matriarchally-based society oriented to the common good.’ (301)
o	‘Clans are female, but include males; nations are male, but include females. All matters must circulate in an ongoing process between these two polar powers.’
o	‘Traditionally, the local and federal were interdependent, equivalent entities, rather than having been hierarchically ordered the way they are in patriarchal dominance societies. The local represented the sacred will of the people, the “grassroots level” of Mother Earth herself, and was run by the clan mothers. In the local clan houses, all decisions were made by consensus among all clan members, and all clan houses were represented in the Women’s Clan Council, an elected body presided over by the Jigonsaseh.’ (305-06)
o	‘The federal side, presided over by the men, was made up not of clans, but of nations, as represented in the League of the Nations in the Men’s Grand Council. Although decisions and messages were communicated and handled here, they did not originate here. The men might only discuss an issue after the women had gone over it, which made the Women’s Clan Council the more powerful one— their deliberations effectively set the men’s agenda. Similarly, if the Men’s Grand Council did not dispose of an issue in the way that the Women’s Clan Council preferred, the women could take up the matter anew, reformulate it, and send it back to the men for reconsideration. This means the women’s council retained what amounted to a judicial review of men’s actions, and could stop them; the men’s council could not do the same to the women’s actions. However, this does not mean the Women’s Clan Council had too much power, because it included the consensus not just of the women in the council, but the consensus of the people—all the clan houses, including the women, men, and children who belonged to them.’ (306)
o	‘The Women’s Clan Council, as sole authority at the local level of government, is the first right of women explicitly granted in the Constitution. The second explicit right is that women are the exclusive guardians of war and peace; that is, they had the right to decide these matters. The concept behind this is that, in order to secure the future of society, women and children must have the absolute right to peace and security. To achieve this, Iroquoian women retained the weapons, relinquishing them only when the Women’s Clan Council had resolved to suspend women’s right to peace, having made this public through their spokespersons, the clan mothers or their male speakers. However, in their traditional way of life this happened only very rarely, for the clan mothers were not interested in sacrificing their children’ (306)
o	‘These two political rights of women may seem to imply that the Iroquois gave too much weight to female power, but in their law, an additional provision emphasized male power. This emphasis emerges in the distinction between “hereditary chiefs,” or clan peace chiefs, whose job was to protect the “Innocents,” resolve conflict, and manage inter-national negotiations, and “merit chiefs,” whose selection was based on their various services to the community. Hereditary chiefs were selected exclusively by women for specific council seats held by the clans, whereas merit chiefs were selected exclusively by men; their selection was based on their merit, although hereditarily seats did not exist. For men, in addition to showing mature judgement, one of the ways to earn merit was by acting as a war chief, a position chosen by men after women had given war a go-ahead.’ (306)
o	‘A feud took place after being decided upon in the war council. In this council, lines of relationship played no role since the merit chief, who sat in the war council, was not elected on the basis of clan structures. Thus, feuds were the formal reason for the resolutions of war council, but often this masked the young men’s thirst for adventure and ambitions for advancement. Feuds were carried out based on private initiative of volunteers, and whether or not a feud actually went forward depended completely on the war chief ’s popularity. He would dig up the hatchet (a red-painted tomahawk decorated with red feathers) and plunge it into the village war post. Then, fully adorned and emitting loud war cries, he would begin the war dance. By then, everyone in the village knew that a feud was planned, and those who voluntarily chose to follow the chief joined in the war dance. However, just as often, no one danced with him, and he went home in disgrace.’ (307-308)
o	‘The Iroquois could not undertake feuds without the explicit consent of women. Additionally, the young men who set off in a war party had to be supplied by the women with long-lasting provisions of cornmeal; otherwise, they could not carry out these forays. The women apportioned the food not only for the feuds, but also for the trade expeditions, so the final decisions about these things were in women’s hands. By withholding their political and economic assent, women in the village or town could stop a feud from taking place. And they did stop it, when the elder lineage chiefs thought it was a bad idea.’ (308)
o	‘The house-based council was not only for handling household matters; it was, at the same time, the vehicle for general policy. The chosen representatives of the Ohwachira participated in clan, town, and federal politics. Every Ohwachira had, in addition, the right to launch political initiatives and could convey the Ohwachira’s wishes and expectations to bodies at the nation level and federal level. In this way, households reflected the wishes and claims of all Iroquois—and even of children, as the voting rules weighted a woman’s vote according to the number of children she had. All political opinion and decision-making was based on household councils. Thus, the social and political order presented itself not as a top-down domination, but as a network based on consensus building from below.’ (310)
o	‘If an Ohwachira possessed a hereditary political office, the opportunities for influencing the greater community expanded considerably. The Sachems were chosen in councils made up of the clan mothers and adult women. The Royaneh had the last word, but, once consensus was achieved, she could not overrule it. Aptitude and experience were deciding factors. In this way, women selected the representatives who made up the political bodies in the town, the nation, and in the League. Therefore, these hereditary chiefs acted primarily in the interests of their own clans, particularly the women. Iroquoian women were present at men’s gatherings and heard everything that went on, and so had great political influence and responsibility.’ (310)
o	‘Sachems, or Peace Chiefs, were responsible for quickly resolving conflicts, whether at the town, national, or federal level, and they took the initiative to settle disputes. Nevertheless, by possessing this title, a man became the delegate of his Ohwachira, so that each Sachem was dependent upon the instructions of the Royaneh. In response to poor performance, or headstrong behavior, or infringement of the ideals or laws of the Confederation, she could unseat him. Custom dictated that an offending Sachem would be warned three times: first by the Royaneh acting alone; then by the clan’s male speaker, the Young Man; and finally by the Royaneh and the Young Man together. If all these did not produce results, the Royaneh would revoke the Sachem’s title and his emblems, giving them to another chosen clan representative. The entire clan would of course be paying attention to the Royaneh’s administrative leadership, and she too could be replaced after three warnings’ (310)
o	‘Also at the national councils, the two clan chiefs—Royaneh and Sachem—were present, but the management of this differed among different nations. The Attiwendaronk were a very special group, their national council seems to have had the maximum number of female members possible: four fifths of their council chiefs were women. The clan mothers were in just about total control among the Attiwendaronk. The Confederacy, however, modified that to a more parallel system of national councils as sphere of men, and clan councils as sphere of women. There were also female chiefs at the level of the Confederation; in fact, there were just as many women as men. This was verified by a white woman ethnologist, who herself was a Seneca female chief in the Iroquois Confederation (Harriet Converse).49 During the wars of conquest, the Gantowisas saw themselves as being obliged to assume, in national and federal councils, the roles of imprisoned and murdered Sachems. In these desperate situations the Seneca and Attiwendaronk Gantowisas even took up arms, fighting as soldiers alongside the men: in 1687 the League’s Jigonsaseh personally assumed military control, and handed the French a heavy defeat in 1689, near Montreal.’ (310-11)
o	‘all these kinship groups and political groups were traditionally responsible to the Councils of Elders; these bodies aggregated the experience and wisdom of age and took vigilant care to ensure that Sachems’ decisions were compatible with traditional social values. They were the guardians of the culture’s unwritten laws. However, the women’s councils spoke first and controlled the agenda of both the Grandmothers’ and Grandfathers’ councils’’ (311)","Post-1142

'Egalitarian relations (Boehm I993, 1996, 1999; Cashdan 1980; Clastres 1977; Gardner 1991; Kelly 1995) are maintained among foragers to facilitate reciprocity and cooperation on five accounts (Wiessner 2002a). (a) They standardize certain information by specifying that all adult members of the society are autonomous equals who cannot command, bully, coerce, or indebt others. (b) They reduce the risks of cooperation because people do not fear that assistance given in the present will be used to dominate in the future. (c) They stipulate that it is the obligation of all people to stand up for their interests and permit all individuals to punish norm defectors, if they choose to do so. (d) They allow individuals and families to choose different options when environmental conditions require dispersal. (e) They facilitate mobility between visiting groups because hierarchies do not mesh easily. Egalitarian institutions vary in how encompassing they are, that is, whether they include adults of both sexes and all ages, and whether equality applies to both opportunity and outcome (Flanagan 1989; Robbins 1994). For the Ju/'hoansi, as for many foragers, equality applies to all adults and to equality of opportunity as well as equality of outcome.' (p. 117)

o	Both women and men participate in market activities
o	‘The mother is not only the progenitor and head of the clan, but in her role as family priest also embodies a unifying principle. Responsibility for all family rituals lies with her, including the enormously important ceremonies for the dead. She is also custodian of all clan property: the communal house and land, and the income from the work of all the clan members. She inherits her position of official successor to the previous clan mother— her own mother. She is custodian of the clan’s property—not with an eye to her own gain, but for the whole clan, for whose well-being she is responsible. She guides distribution of the common wealth, taking care that it is shared out equally, and according to the needs of each, in a give-and-take economy that could well be called a clan internal “gift economy.” Her responsibility is based on natural bonds, not on abstraction, since all of the clan members are her sisters and brothers, her daughters and sons, for whom she cares. In the clan house, among her close relatives she is possessed of a natural authority, rather than a power over them, as encountered in patriarchal domination roles, where people’s needs and wants are not considered. Natural authority means, on her part, giving advice and, on their part, voluntary choice about accepting it or not: a relationship that develops out of family respect. In the clan house she has no staff of enforcement (no police, no army) to make her suggestions into commands.’ (48)
o	‘All the Khasi subgroups follow the matrilineal principle of descent, succession and inheritance. That means, the children carry the name of the mother’s clan and are members of it. Today the father’s clan is also recognized, and is honored; however, the father’s lineage plays no role, as most of the Khasi continue to emphasize matrilinear kinship and solidarity.’ (48)
o	‘The clan’s property remains in the mother’s clan and is passed on from mother to daughter—with minor variation in the different subgroups. With the Khasi it is the youngest daughter, or “Ka Khatduh,” who takes over the entire ancestral property and the material as well as the spiritual responsibility for the “Kur,” or clan: it is the principle of ultima-geniture. She is supported by her eldest maternal uncle, who carries out the actual management and execution of clan property following the consensus of all clan members. The Ka Khatduh is now the new head and priestess of the clan (sub-clan, lineage) and begins her duties with the funeral rites for her revered dead mother, whose devoted support she was until the last.’ (48-49)
o	‘The clan house is the basic political unit, where decisions are made by consensus in the “Durbar Iing,” or family council, which then sends out senior male clan members to represent them in the “Durbar Kur,” or clan council. The clan councils in turn send male representatives out to the “Durbar Shnong,” or local council. The British colonial government later superimposed a district council, which is a formal justice institution; this took away from the local councils the power to settle cases by consensus.’ (51-52)
o	‘Every durbar meeting takes place only with the consensual agreement of the women: without their agreement, no decision can be made.’ (52)
o	‘Neither is the woman a ruler sui generis, rather she only has the right to make decisions in the context of the clan, conforming to its unwritten rules’ (52)
o	‘Matriarchal societies cannot be labeled as democracies—that is a much later political concept—but rather as consensual clan societies. This means that the decision- making process belongs to all the clan members; their discussions are summarized and brought to completion by the clan mother as chief authority, then represented at the village council by the clan mother’s brother. In this way the U Kni’s role is that of a delegate rather than a ruler. The clan would never permit him to exceed the boundaries of this purely executive role by taking steps of his own. In this sense matriarchies are characterized by non-domination of women even while they hold full economic and spiritual authority.’ (52)
o	‘The role of the Khasi head-persons is a good example: the oldest clans may install the “Syiems” (chiefs, or kings) in the various districts that comprise Khasi Land. Using the case of the well-researched district of Khyrim, we can outline the pattern of this “Syiemship.” The Syiem of Khyrim is the son of the “Syiem Sad,” the high priestess of Khyrim. Not he, but rather she, is the actual head of the people; she allows her son or nephew to act as her delegate. She owns the large royal house, in which a sacred column functions as an axis that designates the center of the (Khasi) world. Symbolically speaking, she lives right at the center of the world. Every official sacrifice ceremony begins through her, at the sacred column, and ends there as well. She is the keeper of the symbols: without the crown and all the sacred tools and sacrificial animals no sacrifice can be celebrated. She always performs the first sacrificial act in the house; afterwards, she turns the tools and the animals over to the Syiem, her son, and lets him continue the ceremony outside. This allows her to watch him from her house’ (53)
o	‘The power of women in the matriarchal official structure was not, however, limited to the Syiem Sad. In the history of the Khasi people there have been instances of female Syiems, or queens, who either performed both functions— priestess and executive—or else were daughters of a Syiem Sad’ (54)
o	After the arrival of the British, many self-governing matriarchal institutions were destroyed

Gender + Systemic power imbalance
The Mother and Ka Khatduh had greater decision making power and control over the affairs of the clan. Even though male members were represented in the the durbar (council) by being appointed U kni, ""the U Kni’s role is that of a delegate rather than a ruler. The clan would never permit him to exceed the boundaries of this purely executive role by taking steps of his own. (52)."" Even though a man is appointed syiem, ""Not he, but rather she, is the actual head of the people; she allows her son or nephew to act as her delegate.""
Thus there was a systemic power imbalance in favour of women. 

Ethnic kinship groups + Heterogeneity without a political cleavage
Different clans (matrilineal kinship groups) cooperated through durbars and resolved issues through consensus indicating the absence of a political cleavage.

(Fathauer, p. 97) Mohave are frequently described as warlike, however, Stewart (p. 257) states that people as a whole were pacifically inclined. It was the existence of a distinct class of warriors (Kwanamis) with whom warfare was an obsession among the Mohave that resulted in the frequent warring expeditions. This warring class, just like any other official in Mohave, obtained their status and powers from the spirits in their dreams (Stewart, p. 257). Within a tribe, there were two or three Head Kwanamis who recruited and led the war parties that consisted of the Braves, Kwanamis, and common people (Stewart, p. 260, p. 266; Fathauer, p. 99). People were defined as common if they had not dreamed special powers (Fathauer, p. 99). Another official that accompanied the war party was the Scalper that acted as a Shaman and doctored the warriors (Stewart, p. 269). Scalper was the only one who had dreamed of powers that allowed him to scalp the enemy without being affected by his scalp's magical potency (Stewart, p. 269). 

At home, it was Kwaxot, the main tribal leader, who cared for these war trophies (Fathauer, p. 110). His main responsibility was to ensure tribal integration, which was achieved through his religious position (Fathauer, p. 109). Similarly, this position was obtained from the spirits in a powerful dream (Fathauer, p. 110). 

Decisions regards the tribal internal affairs were conducted through the Informal Council that consisted of Kwaxot and the male heads of each settlement (Fathauer, p. 109). Decisions regards war expeditions, which was a primal aspect of Mohave's external affairs, were conducted through the Conference for Warfare (Fathauer p. 98). There, Mohave's officials such as Kwaxot, Scalper, Head Kwanamis, Braves (Kwanamis) and spies solicited the opinions of some of the wise old men of the tribe (Fathauer p. 98). 

Women played a minor role as their dream was also considered weaker than those of other officials (Fathauer p. 109). Yakatha'alya women would partake in Scalper's ceremony and encourage men to join war parties through shaming (Fathauer p. 109). 

In addition, when Mohave were forced to interact with the Whites, a new official role came to be - Chief for dealing with White People (Fathauer p. 110). Even though, as discussed above, Mohave believed that it was up to spirits to choose the officials by appearing in the special dreams, this was not the case with the Chief for dealing with the Whites (Fathauer p. 109). The first Chief was selected because he was ""lucky"" in his dealings with the Whites, and this position carried on being hereditary (Fathauer p. 109).

Heterogenous without political cleavages
- the Shamanic guild and Tribal council were institutions that created a balance of power between different social and ethnic groups respectively. Each chieftain was a member of the council and each shaman was associated with a guild. 
- Furthermore, shamans could also become chieftains, indicating that there were few social barriers to attaining political power - and hence there were no political cleavages based on social groups.

-	In the absence of written records (or a time machine), there are serious limits to what we can say about kinship and inheritance, or how people in these cities went about making collective decisions. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 294)
-	Still, some clues exist, beginning at the level of individual households. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 294)
-	Each of these had a roughly common plan, but each was also, in its own way, unique.
-	From one dwelling to the next there is constant innovation, even playfulness, in the rules of commensality. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 294)
-	Each family unit invented its own slight variations on domestic rituals, reflected in its unique assemblage of serving and eating vessels, painted with polychrome designs of often mesmerising intensity and made in a dazzling variety of forms. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 294)

-	Individual households would sometimes opt to cluster together in groups of between three and ten families. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 294)
-	Ditches or pits marked their boundaries. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 294)
-	At some sites these groups coalesce into neighbourhoods, radiating out from the centre to the perimeter of the city, and even forming larger residential districts or quarters. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 294)
-	Each had access to at least one assembly house, a structure larger than an ordinary dwelling where a wider sector of the population might gather periodically for activities we can only guess at. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 295)
---------------------------------------------------------

Nebelivka is a mega-site from the Cucuteni-Tripolye culture. A number of other mega-sites have also been documented. Maidanetske seems to be a recreation of Nebelivka's spatial structure a century or two later (there are perimeter boundaries and Assembly Houses creating a 'House -> Neighbourhood -> Quarter -> City' structure). Dobrovody has a similar number of Assembly Houses as Maidanetske, but is missing perimeter boundaries common to the structures of Nebelivka and Maidanetske. Taljanky, the largest mega-site, does not seem to have either of these features. 


-	By 4500 BC, chernozem was widely distributed between the Carpathian and the Ural Mountains, where a mosaic landscape of open prairie and woodland emerged capable of supporting dense human habitation. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 290)
-	The Neolithic people who settled there had travelled east from the lower reaches of the Danube, passing through the Carpathian Mountains. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	We do not know why, but we do know that – throughout their peregrinations in river valleys and mountain passes – they retained a cohesive social identity. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	Their villages, often small in scale, shared similar cultural practices, reflected in the forms taken by their dwellings, female figurines and ways of making and serving food. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	The archaeological name given to this particular ‘design for life’ is the Cucuteni-Tripolye culture, after the sites where it was first recorded. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)

-	So the Ukrainian and Moldovan mega-sites did not come out of thin air. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	They were the physical realisation of an extended community that already existed long before its constituent units coalesced into large settlements. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	Some tens of these settlements have now been documented. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	The biggest currently known – Taljanky – extends over an area of 300 hectares, outspanning the earliest phases of the city of Uruk in southern Mesopotamia. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	It presents no evidence of central administration or communal storage facilities. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	Nor have any government buildings, fortifications or monumental architecture been found.
-	There is no acropolis or civic centre. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)

- In the same two mega-sites with perimeter boundaries —Nebelivka and Maidanetske—a similar pattern of spatial division has been recognized based on four spatial levels—the house, the Neighbourhood, the Quarter, and the entire site (Chapman et al., 2014, 2014a; Ohlrau, 2014). (Chapman, p. 128)

- Turning to the later, Phase CI mega-sites, the basic Nebelivka spatial structure was re-created a century or two later at Maidanetske, with an estimated total of fifteen Assembly Houses and a maximum mean ratio of almost 200 houses per Quarter (Ohlrau, 2014). (Chapman, p. 129)
- A similar number of Assembly Houses is estimated for Dobrovody (Rassmann et al., 2014: 126). (Chapman, p. 129)
- It is even more intriguing, therefore, that only one possible Assembly House has been recognized at Taljanky— after all, the largest known mega-site in the Trypillia world. (Chapman, p. 129)
- The missing perimeter ditch and the absent Assembly Houses at Taljanky seem to us to be two sides of the same coin—an alternative social structure in which different ways of integrating a large population were used in contrast to those at Nebelivka and Maidanetske. (Chapman, p. 129)

- The presence of a perimeter boundary at two mega-sites—Nebelivka and Maidanetske—and their absence from the other two—Taljanky and Dobrovody—suggests major differences in social practices on these sites and the means that they used to integrate subgroups with(out) communal building projects. (Chapman, p. 129)
- The same is true for the absence from Taljanky of Assembly Houses, when these large structures were of such obvious social significance for the mega-sites of Nebelivka, Maidanetske, and Dobrovody. (Chapman, p. 129)

- This is not to say that all mega-structures, whether at Nebelivka or at other mega-sites, will produce identical excavated results. (Chapman, p. 129)
- Yet the first excavation of such a mega-structure has provided an intriguing combination of expanded scale and reduced object deposition. (Chapman, p. 129)
- Further post-excavation studies will doubtless enable us to add more texture and colour to this provocative initial sketch, which contributes another layer of interpretation to the debate on Trypillia ‘urbanism’. (Chapman, p. 129)
---------------------------------------------

Establishment of Nebelivka Quarters:

- Assembly houses were located at a variety of spacings around the outer and inner house circuits. (Chapman, p. 128)
- They occurred in varying combinations: six isolates, five pairs, two trios, and one area with no assembly houses at all. (Chapman, p. 128)
- We consider the location of assembly houses to be of critical importance for the spatial division of the outer and inner house circuits and inner radial streets into the second level of spatial order—the ‘Quarters’. (Chapman, p. 128)
- A critical question concerns the establishment of boundaries between the Nebelivka Quarters. (Chapman, p. 128)
Currently, eight criteria have been used to partition the mega-site into Quarters: (Chapman, p. 128)
(1) ‘Natural’ features, such as palaeo-channels (BUT there are only two palaeo-channels); 
(2) the border half-way between Assembly Houses (BUT this ignores local topographyphies); 
(3) the boundary between (pairs of) Assembly Houses (BUT sometimes there are three Assembly Houses or only one); 
(4) any large gaps between Neighbourhoods (BUT there is often a continuous spread of houses (e.g. E–F, F–G); 
(5) kinks in circuits (BUT these are absent in many parts of the circuit(s));
(6) major variations in the width of the middle (inter-circuit) space; 
(7) gaps in the ditch (BUT some one-third of the outer circuit has no surviving ditch); and 
(8) ‘Obvious’ entrances and passageways (BUT these gaps are not always obvious!).
----------------------------------------------
Assembly House technicalities:

- This mega-structure is currently the largest structure known from the Trypillia-Cucuteni group; the prima facie interpretation would be that such large buildings were some kind of ‘public’ building, performing integrative functions for several parts of the Nebelivka mega-site. (Chapman, p. 120)
- In summary, there were three final stages in the biography of the mega-structure: (Chapman, p. 125)
(1) the temporary or permanent cessation of social practices inside the building; 
(2) a period of as yet unknown duration allowing the build-up of thin levels of Chernozem derived soil layers within the mega-structure; perhaps the mega-structure was not used in this period; and 
(3) two stages of the collapse of the building to produce the ploshchadka.

Composed of banjar (hamlets, with a political function), subak (irrigation society). Each village republic had a representation in the pemaksan. 

Institutional mechanisms in the Banjar (hamlet)
- The krama banjar was composed of the citizenry of the hamlet. A man became a member of this after getting married or having his first child. This ensured that each family had a representative in it.
- The krama banjar met once every 35 days, but special meetings could be called. It made all the important policy decisions with consensus. 
- The krama banjar elected the kilan banjar, a set of leaders (the number of which varied from hamlet to hamlet). They were less like rulers and more like the agents of the krama banjar, since they were responsible for the execution of the decisions made by the krama banjar. There were no codified rules dictating their actions, but the kilan banjar followed its own mode of procedure based on past traditions.  
- The krama banjar was ""the sovereign body in all hamlet affairs, ·punishing any incorrigible resistance to its authority, no matter how apparently trivial, by ostracism"" Thus, the banjar enforced its decisions by criticising and shunning those who did not abide by its dictates.  

Institutional mechanisms in the subak (irrigation society)
- the boundaries between rice fields and the extent/usage rights of each irrigation canal were very clearly defined in the constitution (awig-awig subak), which pre-empted water disputes. 
- Structure and powers identical to the hamlet : it had a krama subak, kilan subak and a constitution (awig-awig subak). However, while the domain of the hamlet was political, that of the subak was economic, specifically, the irrigation of rice fields. 
- the members of krama subak (irrigation assembly) did not include representation from all the village, but only large landowners and those who irrigated their terraces from a shared water source, making it an elite assembly. 
- However, its authority and cultural importance was at par with the hamlet's : ""as in the hamlet, in the sphere of life where public rights and public interests were conceived to be dominant its word was law, defiance of its word crime.""

Relation of Pemaksan to the village republic
""Like the hamlet and the irrigation society, the pemaksan is corporate; like them, it is specifically directed toward certain limited, well defined ends; and, like them, it is essentially autonomous. Its political importance derives from its role as a spiritual group, as theirs derives from their role as a governmental or pro­ductive group."" (pg. 53)",19th century,"Bali, Southeast Asia",Unknown,"Geertz, Clifford, (1980) Negara: The Theatre-state in Nineteenth-century Bali","The exact number of hamlets, which were the essential unit of the village republic ranges widely (from hundreds to thousands according to Geertz). [this is why the size is unknown]

The organisation of the centralised powers in Negara Ubud is not backed by evidence of their actually being put into practise. The overarching system of the raja (king) with a kerajaan (kingdom) is an idealised and necessarily abstract model. Thus, Geertz refers to it ""as a conceptual entity not an historical one."" This is further bolstered by MacRae's argument that the Negara Ubud extended into the 21st century, since even after colonial powers took over, the functioning of the village republics and dadia remained unaltered.  

HETEROGENEITY
- There were separate representation mechanisms for the wealthier farmers in the irrigation society (subak) and for all the families in the village in the banjar. This shows that there was formal inclusion through different institutions. However, the word of the councils was adhered to by all the members of the community, indicating that there was no political cleavage.

HETEROGENEITY
- Informal inclusion and Systemic power imbalance for Gender groups 
Women were said to advise and support men, but “had no say in any matters of importance.” Women could also not be chiefs. 
Institutions only represented men and thus, while there is informal inclusion of women, men are evidently more powerful. 

- Informal inclusion and informal power balance for the group of more intelligent/wiser members. 
Experienced and wise men were consulted by the chiefs in an informal council. This was significant because it was this informal council that chose the war-chief. 
Furthermore, another way of informal (at least from a political point of view) inclusion of intelligent citizens was through the custom of having orators. They are described as “wise and wealthy,” and make speeches that have the power to influence public opinion.

Yuki in contrast to other tribes did not only have one rich person-man. They had three key officials, which consisted of 
the informal head of a local settlement known as the 'person-man' (v’ok-huyako’l), the head chief of a political group that resembled the description of a person-man in tribes above, but was knows as the chief (ti’o’l), and a war leader (tau""-huya""kiki)  (Kroeber, p. 177).

It is not quite clear how far the rich person-man and the chief have merged in native consciousness. 

Nevertheless, the chief is described as being wealthy, friendly to everyone, ready to offer advice, heeded and liked by all, and hospitable (Kroeber, p. 177). He invited and entertained visitors, and might see that a widower's children were taken care of (Kroeber, p. 178). He would notify the owner of a dance house and possessor of the necessary paraphernalia when to make, or begin, a dance (Kroeber, p. 178). He did not lead in battle or fight, but he might tell the war captain when the time for war had come (Kroeber, p. 178). He might not hold his station all his life, since it was necessary for a chief to retain general liking (Kroeber, p. 178). Perhaps a chief that permanently lost public approval would be succeeded in influence by a more popular man of prominence without any formal action having been taken; or he may have been deposed (Kroeber, p. 178). But we know of no such incidents, and they can not have been common (Kroeber, p. 178).

'Person-man' had a number of able-bodied relatives and a store of shell money (Kroeber, p. 178). He had put up a dance house with their aid, which he was regarded as owning or controlling, and had made and kept a number of dance costumes (Kroeber, p. 178).

The war leader seems to have been merely a person of bravery above the average, who had displayed his courage and skill in combat and won the confidence of his people (Kroeber, p. 178). He did not lead the van, in an open fight, but stood aside or behind, advising and encouraging his men (Kroeber, p. 178). In surprise attacks, on the other hand, it is probable that initiative in action rested directly with him (Kroeber, p. 178).

In Jorgensen (1980), tribes such as Yuki, Pomo, Patwin, Maidu, Wappo, Nomlaki, Kato and Mattole are grouped under the same code of '4' for 'Politics'. Their resemblance is that they have the position of the rich-person man in some shape or form. However, in this database Pomo, for example, are coded separately because they also have 'Council'. 
Also, in Jorgensen (1980), Tubatulabal and Kawaiisu are coded under '18' for Politics alongside other tribes such as Paiute, Okanagon, Tenino, Shoshone, Chimariko, Nongatl, Sinkyone. However, for the purpose of this database these two tribes were coded alongside Northern Maidu and Yuki because they also have the position of the rich-person man. The potential reason why Jorgenson (1980) might have coded them separately could be the fact that '4' tend to be a bit more about popularity, and '18' about money.  
Other tribes mentioned in the '4' and '18' have not been researched by Liza, but there is a good chance they also have the position of the 'Rich-person man' considering that the ones mentioned here do.

- The first European attempt at colonization was made in 1793 by Lieut. John Hayes, a British naval officer, near Manokwari, now in Papua province, Indonesia. It was the Dutch, however, who claimed the western half of the island as part of the Dutch East Indies in 1828; their control remained nominal until 1898, when their first permanent administrative posts were set up at Fakfak and Manokwari
-	In the late 19th century, much of New Guinea was brought under British imperial control: 'In response to Australian pressure, the British government annexed Papua in 1888
-	The Protectorate of British New Guinea became Australian territory by the passing of the Papua Act of 1905 by the Commonwealth Government of Australia. The new administration adopted a policy of peaceful penetration, and many measures of social and economic national development were introduced. Local control was in the hands of village constables, paid servants of the Crown. Chosen by European officers, they were intermediaries between the government and the people.
-	By 1884 the German New Guinea Company was administering the northeastern quadrant, and a British protectorate was declared over the southeastern quadrant
-	Australian control of the northeastern quadrant of the island was mandated by the League of Nations
-	But the kind of regional integration that created the Orokaiva as a unit was a product of colonial rule. There was no shared Orokaiva polity prior to colonization; as indicated below, temporary alliances on an ad hoc-basis, influential big men, and autonomous settlements predominated. The size of such unstable quasi-polities probably fluctuated heavily, depending on the influence of local big men and the size of the villages supporting them. We therefore cannot confidently provide a proxy representing a 'typical' quasi-polity
-	These local strongmen were recruited into the constabulary during the colonial period: 'Village Constables. The suppression by force which had marked the early contact phase gave way to a form of ‘indirect rule’ through the appointment of Village Constables. The earliest Village Constables were the strong, leading men who had confronted the Europeans as warriors. As time passed war leaders were no longer a feature of the society, but patrol reports indicate that by and large Village Constables were influential and effective in the maintenance of law and order. The position of Village Constables was an uncomfortable and interstitial one. They had the difficult task of attempting to juggle the interests of their relatives and exchange partners and of the Administration, so that both sides were reasonably happy most of the time. Between 1907 and 1914 the number of Village Constables in the Northern Division rose from fifty-four to eighty-three, indicating that this system of administration was satisfactory to the Australian authorities. The Village Constables were concerned with enforcing legislation which impinged upon many aspects of daily life: burial of the dead, upkeep of roads, construction of latrines, neatness of houses and so on. Failure to obey these regulations could lead to imprisonment.
-	Law
o	Local mechanisms remained important even after colonization: 'For those who remain in the village, the sanctioning mechanisms are mostly informal. Failure in one's obligations means loss of status, leads to gossip, derogatory remarks to one's face, perhaps even a harangue at night by a man at the other end in the village. The councillor, the court and the police are only a last resort in serious quarrels. I saw a councillor enter a dispute once, playing a mediating role between disputants from two villages, but without playing more than an advisory role. One quarrel was taken to court, but this was not a case where traditional mechanisms of social control had failed
o	the Orokaiva, as so many other peoples in contact with Western civilisation, have been quick to see the advantages of a judicial system providing an impartial arbiter in disputes, to whose decisions both parties will defer. At the moment, this western judicial system is an additional resource of Orokaiva law, without undermining its existing institutions
-	Courts
o	Courts were of colonial origin: 'The term pure ari is appropriate to describe the white man's labour if for no other reason than that a ‘job’ just like the pure is a place where one spends the day. The new dispensation has, sure enough, its own conflict (isoro) and mode of conflict resolution. Councillor-Colin brings this out by his example of the policeman who puts village men into handcuffs and takes them off to court. In such a case it was the task of the sorcerer to ensure that the men would escape conviction and be set free again
o	Institutions remained informal on the village level even after colonization: 'For those who remain in the village, the sanctioning mechanisms are mostly informal. Failure in one's obligations means loss of status, leads to gossip, derogatory remarks to one's face, perhaps even a harangue at night by a man at the other end in the village. The councillor, the court and the police are only a last resort in serious quarrels

o	(4) Village Elders and Big Men (Embo Dambo)
o	Government Councils later replaced ad hoc administration by individual officials: 'The Government, keen now to develop a prosperous and loyal colony for defence purposes, no longer used coercion in the establishment of cash crops. They strongly encouraged such activity, but in the context of individual plots as anything co-operative or communal smacked of communism (Schwimmer 1969:86). They promoted coffee and cocoa by promising large, individual returns. The new Local Government Councils became the agencies of the Administration to promote land-tenure conversion and the planting of coffee and Malayan rubber on the individual blocks created.
-	Training of administration
o	While there was some training, it was limited (i.e., mostly ""on the job"") until after WWII, when the Australian School of Pacific Adminsitration (ASOPA) was formed. An attempt that was made In the 1920s to start a formal training course in Sydney for administrative officers (""patrol officers"", also called ""kiaps"") who were bound for Papua. How long the course continued remains in need of confirmation.] Training for constables was largely physical and based on military-style drills. Formal examination seems to have been rare for constables during this time period, although the process may have been more formalized for colonial officials: 'Some idea of the education level reached after the completion of the six months training at the depot in Papua is revealed by Corporal Garuwa’s examination paper
-	Enforcement
o	Failure to obey regulations could lead to imprisonment
o	Occasionally, police would have to deal with a situation
-	Law
o	But legal codes were introduced by the colonial authorities: 'When the Papuan Act was passed in 1905 by the Australian Commonwealth Parliament, it provided a legal framework for the Australian Administration in the whole of the Territory, of which Northern Division was a part. Ordinances whose provisions had a particular relevance for Northern Division were those that imposed a tax and made cash cropping, carrying and roadbuilding compulsory

o	Big men' exercised informal authority only and relied on their ability to recruit followers
o	The leader and ruler of any clan is the eldest of its men, provided he is not so old as to be incompetent, and provided always that his personality is equal to his position
	The implication is that the real chief is the man who gives his name to his followers, i.e. the man by whose name they are collectively known
	
-	The Orokaiva population relied on a decentralised political system based on clans and relatively autonomous local groups: 'Every Orokaiva is recruited by birth into the clan of his or her father
-	Each clan is subdivided into named subgroups or lineages that trace their origin to a named ancestor
-	Orokaiva political organization was fluid and not centralized: 'Political organization incorporates no central authority or hereditary leadership. Instead, it is characterized by big-men (EMBO DAMBO) and an ascendancy of elders who have proved themselves equal to the task. Such men command the respect of the village, based upon observed qualities of generosity, diligence, wealth, ability to make wise decisions, and skill in arranging ceremonial activities. This status confers no sanctioning authority, however. The Orokaiva tribes, around twelve in number, are very loose units politically and recognize no single leader. The largest unit is the tribe, which has a common territory usually demarcated from neighboring tribal territories by a belt of uninhabited land.' [11] 'The social system is characterized by flexibility in arrangements for group membership and for transmission of rights to land. A village normally contains more than one clan branch and consequently is not necessarily a landholding unit. Residents may have closer kinship ties to residents of other villages than with some of their coresidents. Nevertheless, common residence implies some community of interest and a degree of group solidarity that is reinforced by government policy, which recognizes villages rather than descent groups as functional entities. Marriages between members of different clan branches within the village also reinforce this solidarity, which is expressed in ways such as daily food gifts, cooperation in certain tasks, and joint ceremonial activities. On the average, a lineage comprises three households. Usually, several clans are represented in a village, with members of a single clan (clan branches) being scattered among a number of neighboring villages. Lineages are more localized in character, frequently being confined to a single village and tending to occupy one section of it.'
-	Very small minorities of Micronesian and Polynesian societies can be found on some of the outlying islands and atolls, and as in the eastern and northern Pacific these people have political structures headed by chiefs, a system seldom found among the Melanesian peoples of Papua New Guinea
-	The Orokaiva population was not organized around a capital.
-	The Orokaiva lacked central authority and hereditary leadership. The closest thing they had to leaders were big men (embo dambo) and elders, who commanded the respect of their neighbours due to their personal qualities, including their ability to make wise decisions and their skill in organizing ceremonies. However, they still lacked authorities with the power to issue sanctions.[37]
-	It is assumed here that the Orokaiva resided in the same territory during the immediate pre-colonial period. But the kind of regional integration that created the Northern Division as a political entity was a product of colonial policies. Prior to that, unstable quasi-polities dominated the scene. The territory controlled by these probably fluctuated heavily, depending on the influence of local big men and the size of the villages supporting them. Also, tribes used to keep large tracts of uninhabited land betweem them. We therefore cannot confidently provide a proxy measure here.
-	The largest unit was the tribe. In the early 20th century the Orokavia population was about 9000, which would make each tribe about 750 people, on average. The Aiga had 1300 people spread over 50 villages. [44] [45] The number of Orokaiva at the time of first contact is unknown due to lack of demographic data: 'The indigenous population of the Popondetta district totals some 36,500, of whom 26,500 are Orokaiva in the central lowland area. The number of Orokaiva at the time of Western contact is not known. [Editors note: Ethnologue (SIL International), lists 33,400 as of 1989.]' [46] Williams claims around 9,000 residents for the early 20th century. [This is a realistic figure. If conflicting figures exist, these will be found in the Papua Annual Reports.]
-	Residents may have closer kinship ties to residents of other villages than with some of their coresidents. Nevertheless, common residence implies some community of interest and a degree of group solidarity that is reinforced by government policy, which recognizes villages rather than descent groups as functional entities. Marriages between members of different clan branches within the village also reinforce this solidarity, which is expressed in ways such as daily food gifts, cooperation in certain tasks, and joint ceremonial activities.

-	Administrative levels
o	Leaders of Ad Hoc Alliances
o	Village Elders and Big Men (Embo Dambo)
o	Wives and retainers
	Political authority was confined to the informal leadership of elders and local big men who ""command[ed] the respect of the village, based upon observed qualities of generosity, diligence, wealth, ability to make wise decisions, and skill in arranging ceremonial activities"" but whose authority did not extend beyond their immediate community.[56] Big men relied on the support of wives and retainers.[57] According to Williams, village and clan clusters occasionally formed ad hoc alliances when facing external threats,[58] so we included them in the code as well.
-	Ritual practices by local practitioners
o	Ghosts are invoked during ceremonies by divination to reveal crimes and criminals
-	Law
o	Local law was informal: 'There is a word igege (Binandele yege) which may be translated ‘moral law’, or perhaps, since the examples are all negative, ‘moral prohibition’. The examples were such as the following: not to steal a man's vegetables, canoes, spears, &c.; not to usurp his fishing rights; not to take his dog to hunt, but to drive it back if it followed the hunter of its own accord; not to commit adultery; not to beat one's wife overmuch; not to commit assault on another man. These igege were for adults; they did not apply to children, who had to be treated with so much indulgence; still less to dogs, whose nature it was to steal on sight. While not implying standardization, the mere existence of the word hints at a definite conception of right and wrong.' [84] 'There are customary restrictions upon feuding within the tribe, which exist in sharp contrast to the standard acceptance and formalization of hostility between tribes. Formerly, official legal penalties, generally violent, were meted out to criminals. Fear of the ancestors and desire to avoid unfavorable public opinion remain the major mechanisms of social control
-	Social classes
o	There were no social classes. Orokaiva society was organized in patrilineal clans rather than social classes: 'Every Orokaiva is recruited by birth into the clan of his or her father. All members of a clan claim, but cannot necessarily trace, common descent from a usually eponymous ancestor. Each clan is subdivided into named subgroups or lineages that trace their origin to a named ancestor
-	Normative ideology
o	Initially, political authority was confined to the informal leadership of elders and local big men (see Embo Dambo above)
o	The labour and support of wives and younger men was key in the career of big men: 'Without multiple wives or a pool of single men retainers, the scope for a leader in large-scale exchange is limited. The lack of retainers attaching themselves to leaders' households could perhaps be due to the end of warfare and to improved community health so that there are now few orphans or fatherless sons. Almost every youth has a father or older brother to guarantee the payment of his brideprice. The productive relations between old men and young men are interesting in that they provide the possibility for a form of exploitation or unequal return for equal work, with the old men withholding the young men's access to a bride.'
o	Generosity was culturally valued and also served as a major recruitment mechanism: 'Perhaps the most characteristic of them all is liberality. The liberal man is handembo, the word hande meaning distribution, or especially the sharing out of food. It is easy to understand how this should be a popular virtue, for the Orokaiva, like other natives, are much addicted to the making of feasts-and not because of a merely gluttonous appetite, as some who know least about natives have supposed, but more because of the glamour and the excitement of a social gathering
	Gift economy
•	It is thought honourable to be liberal and leave to others, but people also demand to have their kindness returned

- Can be carried out by the closest individual, the 'family, section, clan, or tribe' (p. 150)
- Social or economic status doesn't deter other agents from carrying out badal. However, if the target is well-protected, justice may be carried out on his kin

Badal may have adverse effect on the economy, as targets would rather hide from potential attackers than to tend to their fields.
- Therefore, there exists a possibility for mediation through the Council of Elders, 'Jirga'. It may arrange a truce or termination of hostilities. 'Certain conditions,
such as monetary compensation, may be imposed to achieve a balance in the redress of grievances.' (p. 151)
- 'Once a party has submitted to arbitration by Jirga, it is bound to follow the Jirga's ruling.' (p. 152) Violation of rulings may lead to a fine or to a burning of the resisters' homes.

Introduction of ""simple communes"":
-	""But down into the 16th century there continued to be a vast area, known as “black land”, where it [private landowning] had not yet been introduced."" (Blum, p. 93)
-	""Though quantitative data are lacking, it seems probable that the total extent of the black land exceeded that of privately owned."" (Blum, p. 93)
-	""The practice of turning over black land to private lords became increasingly frequent from the latter part of the 15th century on."" (Blum, p. 93)
-	""As a consequence, the great majority of the peasantry in the 16th century were renters of land that belonged to private proprietors of that was held by pomeshchiks on service tenure."" (Blum, p. 93)
-	""By the 17th century, landowners had broken up most of the old volost’ communes in the Central Non-Black Earth region."" (Moon, p. 201)
-	""They replaced them with smaller and weaker communes, which coincided with their estates."" (Moon, p. 201)
-	""In the 18th and 19th centuries, over ¾ of communes in the European part of Russia coincided with single villages."" (Moon, p. 201)
-	""They were known as “simple communes”.""
-	""There were smaller numbers “split” and “composite” communes."" (Moon, p. 201)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Administration (Institutions):
-	""Many landowners appointed managers (upravlyayushchie) and stewards or bailiffs (prikazshchiki) to administer their estates."" (Moon, p. 202)
-	""They worked with officials from the village communes."" (Moon, p. 202)
-	Communes on lands belonging to monasteries, the state or the court had similar officials. (Moon, p. 202)
-	The names, methods of appointment and duties of peasant functionaries varied from village to village. (Moon, p. 202)
-	In most villages, there was a headman (burmistr), a tax-collector (tseloval’nik) and a clerk (zemskii), who was sometimes a sacristan from the parish church. (Moon, p. 202)
-	Many villages also had elders (starosty), foremen (starshina) and selectmen (vybornye). (Moon, p. 202)
-	They were assisted by overseers (smotriteli) and constables (sotskie, pyatidesyatskie, desyatskie). (Moon, p. 202)
-	Most communes had a churchwardern (tserkovanyi starosta). (Moon, p. 202)
-	Peasant functionaries were either appointed by the landowner, sometimes with the approval of the communal assembly (skhod), or elected by the assembly and confirmed in office by the estate management. (Moon, p. 202)
-	Some peasant functionaries were paid by their landowners or were recompensated by having their seigniorial obligations reduced or waived. (Moon, p. 202)
-	Others received payment from their communes, which raised taxes from their members for this purpose. (Moon, p. 202)
-	More widespread were estates on which landowners (usually absentees) entrusted most administration to communes. (Moon, p. 202)
-	Communal officials ran the villages, and reported back to the landowners, who retained overall control but did not interfere in the internal life of villages. (Moon, p. 202)
-	Such landowners’ interests did not extent much beyond the receipt of the obligations they demanded. (Moon, p. 202)
-      On some estates, with the agreement of the landowner or estate authorities, communes were in charge of issuing passports to peasants who wanted to leave the village to work as migrant labourers. (Moon, p. 225)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Downfalls of this system:
Poor elections:
-	""… findings of a survey of state peasant villages made in the late 1830’s by government inspectors."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""They reported that commune meetings often degenerated into drinking bouts."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""At elections of mir officials the successful candidate frequently turned out to be the man who bought the most drinks for the voters."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""The rich peasants in the commune generally did not run for office themselves."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""Instead, they backed others who, when elected, repaid their wealthy supporters by special favours, such as reductions in the payment they had to make."" (Blum, p. 523)

Poor clergy:
-	""The clerk of the mir enjoyed much power and prestige, for often he was the only person in the commune who could read and write."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""Unfortunately, his learning was usually small and his palm easily crossed."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""As a result, in many communes the account books were in a state of confusion."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""That made it easier for dishonest officials to conceal their misuse or appropriation of mir’s assets."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""Sometimes these embezzlers stole just small amounts, but on occasion they gave full rein to their acquisitive instincts; the government inspectors discovered that in two communes in Vologda peculations amounted to 32,091 rubles."" (Blum, p. 524)

Excessive power of Proprietor:
-	""On privately owned land every act of the mir was subject to the review of the proprietor."" (Blum, p. 524)
-	""He could cancel any of its decisions, could replace elected officials with men of his own choosing, could command repartition of holdings or forbid it, and, indeed, could disband the commune itself."" (Blum, p. 524)
-	""But such actions were exceptional."" (Blum, p. 524)
-	""Normally the lord, even when he lived on his property and personally supervised its operation, allowed the mir much autonomy, conferred with its leaders before he introduced changes, and turned over to it much of the internal administration of the property."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The mir officials apportioned the obligations the seignior demanded among its members in proportion to the amount and quality of land they had, or to their other sources of income."" (Blum, p. 525)
---------------------------------------------------------------
State Land and the Rules for the Operation of Communes:
-	""On state land the government, in the first part of the nineteenth century, laid down a number of rules for the operation of communes."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""To begin with, it ordered the creation of mirs in every village of state peasants, though small settlements could choose to join the communes of neighbouring larger places."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The law ordered the land of the village to be held communally, and gave the mir the responsibility of dividing it among its members."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The commune could rent additional state-owned land for its own uses, and with official permission could buy and exchange land with private persons, or rent part of its own land to outsiders."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The periodic redistribution of communal land was the mir’s most important function."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The frequency of these repartitions fluctuated widely."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""Often they were carried out after each general revision. "" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""Some communes, however, made general redistributions at shorter intervals such as every six years, and even annual redistributions were not unknown."" (Blum, p. 525)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Starozhil’tsy vs Novoprikhodtsy vs Polovnik peasants:
Peasant were categorised as Starozhil’tsy (old inhabitants),  Novoprikhodtsy (newcomers) or Polovnik (sharecroppers)
-	Newcomers were excused from all or part of the obligations. (Blum, p. 98)
-	Peasant was a newcomer for a set period of time agreed between the landlord and the new peasant on his arrival. (Blum, p. 98)
-	It ran usually from 5 to 15 years. (Blum, p. 98)
-	Polovnik greed to remain with the lord for an agreed upon number of years and to pay a fixed proportion of his crop to the lord as rental. (Blum, p. 100)
-	On his arrival polovnik received a loan of cash or of grain from the landlord in order to get started on his farming, and to carry him over until he brought in his first crop. (Blum, p. 100)


------------------------------------------------------------
Size:
- In the early centuries of Russia's history the peasants whether black people or renters on privately owned land, lived usually in isolated farmsteads or in tiny hamlets. (Blum, p. 504)
- This pattern of settlement persisted well into the 16th century. (Blum, p. 504)
- Then peasants began to give up living in isolated farmsteads and came together into villages. (Blum, p. 504)
- (1850s) In terms of population rather than number of homesteads the most common settlement size was between 51 and 300 people. (Blum, p. 506)
Out of 100,299 settlements:
5.2%  (5,238) had fewer than 10 inhabitants
22.5% (22,456) had between 11 and 50
53% (53,077) had between 51 and 300
8.5% (8,593) had between 301 and 500
6.6% (6,651) had between 501 and 1,000
3.0% (3,030) had between 1,001 and 2,000
1.2% (1,254) had between 2,001 and 25,000

- Estimates of the total population of Russia at the end of the 16th century vary between 2.5-2.9 million and 11 million, but a figure of 7 million seems plausible. (Moon, p. 20)
- On 28 January 1897 the first, and only, general census of the population of the Russian Empire was held. (Moon, p. 11)
- The 1897 census: total population of 125.6 million. (Moon, p. 12)","15th-16th centuries

- The Board of Supervisors can adopt close-range ordinances which increases the liability of ranchers. Constituents who wish for a close-range ordinance must submit a petition 'that identifies a specific territory for closure, gather signatures on copies of the petition, and forward the signed petition to the Board.' (p. 643) 'Upon receiving a petition, the Board's staff drafts an ordinance that will implement the closure and publicizes a hearing on the proposed measure.' (p. 644) Opponents may gather signatures for a counter-petition. 'At the public hearing, the Board hears statements from proponents and opponents and then votes on the measure.' (p. 644)

Ranchers sometimes (e.g. when settling fence disputes) ignore Californian or county laws in favour of their traditions.

- Fight for open ranges to let cattle roam free during summer 
Modernists
- Keep cattle enclosed at all times
- More active in managing vegetation
- 'tend to be younger than traditionalists, have more formal education, and be more active in the Cattlemen's Association' (p. 639)

Philosophy of live and let live
- Reciprocal restraint. The ranchers acknowledge that they will be on the receiving and giving ends of trespassing incidents which strengthens solidarity among them.

Due to regular damage caused by wildlife, the ranchers 'regard minor damage from alien animals not as an injurious event, but as an inevitable part of life.' (p. 674)

The ranchers very rarely pursue formal litigation. Reasons from interviewees: ""I'm not that kind of guy;"" ""I don't believe in it;"" ""I don't like to create a stink;"" ""I try to get along."" (p. 681) Trespass conflicts resolved  beyond the shadow of the law.

•	The king had to mark himself as outside conventional morality through acts such as murder, incest or cannibalism. ‘Always, such acts marked the king as a kind of “sacred monster,” a figure, effectively, outside of morality.’ (70)
	‘The Shilluk kingdom was clearly not a state. The Shilluk reth, or king, lacked any sort of administration and had little way to enforce his will.’ (65)
	Sort of egalitarian
	Rituals conducted by the reth
	Elites/nobility
	Possible belief that the reth was possessed by gods
	Institutionalised regicide
•	The Shilluk king, or reth, was indeed said to embody a divine being—a god, or at least a demigod—in the person of Nyikang, the legendary founder of the Shilluk nation. Every king was Nyikang. The reth was not supposed to die a natural death. He might fall in battle with the nation’s enemies. He might be killed in single combat after a rival prince demanded a duel, as they had a right to do, or be suffocated by his own wives or retainers if he was seen to be physically failing
•	Others have argued that it is the kingship and not the king which is divine
•	‘It is the community as a whole that must kill the king’
	Kings act as scapegoats for the wrongdoings of the society. Because he has already committed a crime, it is right to kill him anytime and thus cleanse the society
	‘kingship was originally a ritual institution. Only later did it become something we would think of as political—that is, concerned with making decisions and enforcing them through the threat of force.’ (72)
	‘Ordinarily, Shilluk kings did not even have the power to appoint or remove village chiefs. In the complete absence of any sort of administrative apparatus, their power was almost entirely personal: Nyadwai created and destroyed Ogam’s village using his own personal resources, his own herd of cattle, his own personal band of retainers. If he had tried to exterminate the lineage of a real village chief, not one he had made up, he would likely have found himself in very serious trouble. What’s more, a reth’s power in fact was almost entirely dependent on his physical presence’ (76)
	During disputes, the reth mostly acted as a mediator rather than as an enforcer
	‘In other words, kings often really would take on the role attributed to them in rain dramas: of spitefully unleashing arbitrary destruction on the people they were supposed to protect.’ (80)
	‘The king’s senior wife seems to have acted as his chief minister, and had the power to hold court and decide legal cases in the reth’s absence’ (85)
	‘In the absence of any administrative apparatus, royal women also appear to have become the key intermediaries between Fashoda and other communities. Essentially they played all the roles that court officials would otherwise play.’ (86)
	‘Princesses might also be appointed as governors over local districts(Hofmayr 1925: 71; Jackson in Frost 1974: 133–34), particularly if their brothers became king.’ (86)
	‘Shilluk society was in no sense a matriarchy. While women held extraordinary power within the royal apparatus, that apparatus was not in itself particularly powerful. The fact that the queen could render judicial judgments, for instance, is less impressive when one knows royal judgments were not usually enforced. Governance of day-to-day affairs seems to have rested firmly in the hands of male settlement chiefs, who were also in charge of electing a new king when the old one died. Village women also elected their own leaders, but these were much less important. Property passed in the male line.’ (87)
	‘(divine, arbitrary) power seems to have been increasingly contained within a ritual apparatus where royal women played the central political role.’ (87)
	Reths could create monopolies and impose taxes
	After the British rule was established ‘the reth was reduced to the usual tax-collector and administer of local justice under a system of indirect colonial rule’ (89)
	‘Today, the position of the reth remains, but, like the Shilluk themselves, just barely’ (89)
	‘The role of the Ororo is crucial. This is a class who represent a veritable institutionalization of this constitutive relation of hostility, and potential violence, on which the eternity of the kingdom is founded. Generally, the descendants of any prince who is not elected, should they grow numerous, become a named lineage within the royal clan, and the tomb of their princely ancestor becomes their lineage shrine. All members of such lineages are considered royals. In theory, the king can degrade any of these branches to Ororo status by attempting to sneak into their lineage shrine at night and performing certain secret rites, but the shrines are guarded, and if the king in question is caught, the attempt is considered to have failed.’ (99)

Ultimate political authority in Siena rested with the city council (the Council of the Bell), which existed from 1176, and which intervened in all types of issues faced by the commune. From 1287 to 1355, while ultimate legitimacy remained with the Council of the Bell, the affairs of the commune were controlled by a committee of nine magistrates who held the title of the Nine Governors and Defenders of the Sienese Commune.

'A conquered tlatoani who proved unfriendly could be replaced by outside intervention in favor of local nobles who were more compliant' (p. 47)

'The supreme authority for the empire was a body composed of an inner council that included the heads of the three principal cities and four prime ministers' (p. 48)

'An outer council included this inner group as well as “all lords of the empire.” This was not the type of council characterized by early democracy because it referred principally to bureaucratic subordinates.'

- Aztec king: 'tlatoani' (pl. 'tlatoque')

'Tlatoque were selected by a high council of tetecuhtin nobles, male kin of the deceased ruler. Usually a brother or a son succeeded to the ofﬁce, but sometimes a nephew or grandson of the previous ruler was chosen (see the genealogy of the Mexica tlatoque in ﬁgure 2.9). The council deliberated to ﬁnd the appropriate successor, who was viewed as the god Tezcatlipoca’s selection to the post.' (p. 154)

'The tlatoani was assisted by a council of nobles and a series of lower-ranking bureaucrats. Other lords served as judges to hear suits, and in some city-states there was a group of superior or appeals judges.' (p. 155)

'In the Aztec case, however, the institutions of government gave commoners and nonroyal nobles some level of say and participation in civic affairs. Indeed, the processes of city-state governance can be viewed as a system of negotiation between the king, the nobility, and groups of commoners. The actions of kings were limited by the royal council – nobles who selected kings and on occasion may have deposed bad kings. The judges described by Zorita helped protect the rights of commoners, who received beneﬁts in the form of key services provided by the king.' (p. 156)

'In Blanton and Fargher’s analysis, the Aztecs are closer to the Greek city-states than to the African kingdoms.' (p. 156)
- More collective than autocratic


Enforcement:

'The installation of a new Mexica tlatoani involved a series of elaborate ceremonies and activities – a rite of passage through which the chosen noble was transformed into a being worthy of speaking in the voice of Tezcatlipoca. First, the candidate stood naked before the image of the god Huitzilopochtli to present offerings. He then went into retreat with his tetecuhtin for four days of fasting and penance. Upon emergence, he was required to lead a brief military excursion to gather captives for sacriﬁce at his installation ceremony. An all-night prayer vigil to Tezcatlipoca preceded the formal installation ceremony. The entire kingdom and tlatoque and nobles from other citystates were invited to witness the pageants, theatrical presentations, dances, musical performances, and human sacriﬁces that accompanied the ruler’s installation. These ceremonies were intended to impress upon the citizens the link between the new king and the god Tezcatlipoca, the supernatural basis for political authority.'

'The provinces themselves were administered by governors (Sumerian énsi), who were royal appointees and could in theory be removed from office or transferred to other posts at the king's pleasure. In practice, however, the office of the governor tended to be hereditary, especially in the latter parts of the period.' (p. 19)
- the kings wished to prevent the office from being hereditary. 'But as conditions began to deteriorate with the accession of Šu-Sin, the preservation of the state became progressively dependent upon the continued support of local elites.'

As such, Royal Court had high enough authority to impose corporal punishments. Vizier, acting as Pharaoh's deputy, oversaw the administration of the Royal Court and partook in the decision-making process. Royal Court itself was heavily bureaucratic just like Egypt in general and was divided into various departments such as treasury, police, district, and each department had its main overseer who had to answer to Vizier. To ensure Vizier's informedness there was an institution of 'Hearers' who acted as the system of bureaucratic control. 

There were also local Pharaoh's administrations around Egypt run by the Herald, who informed Pharaoh of people's aspirations and acted as pharaoh's mouthpiece.
For local decision-making and legal proceedings there were two councils - Djadjat and Qenbet. Djadjat was the dominant council in the Old and Middle Kingdoms, and Qenbet was dominant in the New Kingdom. However, they both did exist during all three kingdoms just with varying levels of importance. From the readings, I got the impression that Qenbet was more concerned with local justice and Djadjat with local governance. They were run by local notables such as Mayors and Priests.


A story about the 'Eloquent Peasant' that shows the Egyptian Institution of Petitioning:

----- BACKSTORY OF ROBBERY -----
p. 1
“There was a man called Khunanup. He was a peasant of the Wadi Natrun and he had a wife called Meret”
“This peasant said to his wife of his: ‘Look, I am going to Egypt to fetch provisions there for my children’”
p. 3
“[???]”
p. 5
“He [peasant] came across a man”
“His name was Nemtinakht and he was the son of a man called Isry”
“These were liegemen of the high steward Rensi, son of Meru”
“And the Nemitinakht said, when he saw the donkeys of this peasant, which were desirable to his heart:”
p. 6
“‘Would that I had some divine image with which I could rob the good of this peasant!”
“Now, the house of the Nemtinakht was at a waterside path that was narrow, it was not broad: it measured the width of a loincloth. Its one side was under water, the other=er under barley.”
“This Nemtinankht then said to a servant of his:”
p. 7
“’Hurry, and bring me a cape from my house!’”
“Then he spread it out on the waterside path, so that its hem came to rest on water, and its selvage on the barley.”
“And this peasant came on the public path”
“This Nemtinakht then said: ‘Beware, peasant, you will not step on my clothes!”
p. 8
“And the peasant said: ‘I shall do what you wish; my way is good.’”
“And he went up higher. Then this Nemtinakht said: ‘Is my Upper-Egyptian barley to be a path for you?’”
“And this peasant said: ‘My ways are good; the bank is steep, and the ways are under barley for you block our path with your clothes!’”
p. 9
“’Will you then not allow us to pass on the path?’”
“As he had finished saying […] words, then one of the donkeys filled its mouth with a wisp of barley.”
“And this Nemtinakht said: ‘But look, your donkey is eating my barley!”
p. 10
… “I will buy my donkey for 10 times the value”
“Now, I know the lord of this district; it belongs to the high steward Rensi, son of Meru. He is the one who restrains every thief in this entire land.”
“Shall I now be robbed in his district?”
p. 11
…
“Then, he [Nemtinakht] took a rod of fresh tamarisk to him, and he thrashed all his [peasant’s] limbs with it, took his donkey away and drove them to his district”

----- STORY OF PETITIONING -----
p. 13
“Then this peasant spent a period of 10 days pleading with this Nemtinakht, but he did not pay attention to it.”
“This peasant then went to Herakleopolis in order to plead with the high steward Rensi, son of Meru”
p. 14
“He [peasant] found him [high steward Rensi] emerging from the door of his house, to step into his official boat.”
“And this peasant said: ‘May I be allowed to inform you about this grievance. Perhaps one may have a servant of your choice come to me, so that I may have him report to you about it.’”
p. 15-16
“And the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, had a servant of his choice go to him, and this peasant had him report back about this entire matter.”
“Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, accused the Nemitinakht to the officials who were with him.”
“But then they said to him: ‘Perhaps it is a peasant of his who went to someone else behind him. Look, that is what they do to peasants of theirs who have gone to others beside them. That is what they do. Is this a cause for punishing this Nemtinakht, on account of I little natron and a little salt? If he is ordered to replace it, then he will replace it.’”
p. 16
“But the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, remained silent.”
p. 17
“He did not answer these officials, nor did he answer this peasant.”
“Then this peasant came to pleas with him”
p. 21
“The high steward Rensi, son of Meru, then went before His Majesty and said: ‘My lord, I have found one of these peasants who is truly eloquent. By a man who is my peer. His goods have been robbed. He has come to please with me about it.’”
p. 22-23
“And His Majesty said: ‘As you wish to see me in health, you will delay him here without answering anything he says. So that he keeps speaking, remain silent. So that his speech will be brought to us in writing. So that we may hear it. But provide sustenance for the wife and children of this peasant. That one of these peasants comes here is because his house is empty. […] Furthermore, provide sustenance for this peasant himself. You will let the provisions be given to him without letting him know.’”
p. 24
“They were given to friends of his and his friends gave them to him.”
“Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, sent a message to the mayor of the Wadi Natrun about making provisions for the wife of this peasant.”
p. 36
“And the peasant came to plead with him for a third time”
P. 44
“When this peasant had said these words, the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, went to the entrance of the portal…”
p. 45
“…and made two guards turn against him with whips, and they thrashed all his limbs therewith”
p. 54
“You were appointed to hear cases, to judge between litigants and to punish the robber”
“But look, what you are doing is supporting the thief”
p. 59
“…and your environment is corrupt. And every man in your environment is corrupt”
p. 60
“High steward, my lord, you are the helm of the entire land, the land sails in accordance with your command. You are the equal of Thoth, who judges without being partial.”
p. 64
“Yet officials should be people who dispel injustice, lords of goodness, craftsmen in creating what is, people who men a severed head.”
p. 71
“And this peasant came to plead with him for a ninth time”
p. 76
“Look, I am pleading with you but you do not hear it.”
“I will go and plead concerning you with Anubis.”
“Then, the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, sent two guards to bring him back”
…
p. 77
“Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, said: ‘Don’t be afraid, peasant! Look, you will arrange the matter with me’” …
p. 78
“The high steward Rensi, son of Meru, said: ‘Now wait here and hear your petitions!’ And from a new papyrus roll he had every petition read out according to [its] content”
“Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, delivered them to the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Nebkaure, justified and they pleased his heart more than anything in his entire land.”
p. 79
“Then His Majesty said: ‘Pass judgement yourself, son of Meru!’
“And the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, sent two guards to [fetch Nemtinakht] Then he was brought and inventory was made of”
p. 80

- 'Decision making was achieved through speechmaking and debate until a consensus was reached (p. 237)

- 'Those who aspired to a role on the council of Tlaxcala, far from being expected to demonstrate personal charisma or the ability to outdo rivals, did so in a spirit of self-deprecation – even shame. They were required to subordinate themselves to the people of the city. To ensure that this subordination was no mere show, each was subject to trials, starting with mandatory exposure to public abuse, regarded as the proper reward of ambition, and then – with one’s ego in tatters – a long period of seclusion, in which the aspiring politician suffered ordeals of fasting, sleep deprivation, bloodletting and strict regime of moral instruction.

'At its center was the belief that each clan would join together to fight against a renegade clan that attempted to gain political dominance over the city and its economic resources.' (p. 644)

The powers of the doge were limited, so as not allow him to shift the balance of power. This was done by rules which also 'established tight administrative control over gains from interclan political cooperation, and allocated these rents among all the important Venetian clans fairly so all had a share in them regardless of clan affiliation.' (p. 644)

'Starting in 1032, the Doge’s authority was limited through the establishment of advisory councils until it was de facto altered from an elected monarchy to a republican magistracy. In 1172 it was established that a Doge should never act contrary to the advice of his councilors.' (p. 644)

'The conduct of all officials (including the Doge) was subject to scrutiny by committees to prevent unlawful gains.' (p. 644)

The institutions disincentivised the creation of patronage networks

'there were no formal constitutional rules limiting the doge's power. Once elected, the doge had absolute power with unlimited authority over all constitutional, administrative, political, and military matters. The factor that prevented doges from de facto assuming dictatorial powers was not the expectation of popular retaliation, as the coordination view might suggest. Rather, doges were constrained by a number of rival clans with relatively high administrative capacities.' (González de Lara (2008), p. 106)

Elaborate rituals 
- they were “calculated to bind initiates together as metaphorical brothers” and establish bonds of kinship.  
- “The initiation rites themselves were elaborate – and even more so for those promoted to the higher ranks of fellowcraft and master Mason – involving gestures, an oath and ceremonial garb”
- the initiation rite also included a vow of secrecy, i.e. an oath based on Masonic principles that the member would never reveal the information given to him 

Dynamics within the logde 
Each lodge had a master, wardens and other officers. Prospective Masons had to be nominated for membership and approved unanimously
The ‘Charges’ said that all Masons were equal and “part of the appeal of the lodges was precisely that they allowed nobleman and bourgeois to mingle.” However, “those of a higher social station often held the most prestigious positions”
But the fact that there was equal respect and consideration for all members is shown by incidences of well to-do members providing for the widows of dead masons in accordance with the principle of fraternity.

The institutions of the lodge - the entered apprentice, Fellow of the craft and Master of the craft included members of different socio economic groups. The constitution declared that all members were equal, indicating formal inclusion. However, “those of a higher social station often held the most prestigious positions.” This prevalence of the dominant social groups in positions of greater power points towards an informal power imbalance. 
But the fact that there was equal respect and consideration for all members is shown by incidences of well to-do members providing for the widows of dead masons in accordance with the principle of fraternity.

Village chiefs also preferred to move to higher elevations not only because of the higher yield, but also because it was more difficult for tax collection officals/ imperial armies to climb steep slopes. (Scott)
Villages tended to be small and very close knit. This meant that there were strong inter-familial ties and the village tended to migrate together.

Land and agricultural produce were usually owned collectively by a kaum. In the case of disputed land between kaums, the buah gadang, which was made of kaums attempted to resolve it amicably. However, if this did not happen, the matter was taken to the matriarchal council or panghulu, who had the final word. 
""the panghulu retains the highest authority also in property affairs. No transfer of any buah gadang property, share-cropping agreements excepted, may occur without its taking cognizance."" (pg. 66)

Buah gadang
""Their mutual relationships, hierarchical order, and the formation of more inclusive groups of buah gadang are regulated in the nagari's constitution."" The constitution essentially gave the power of forming new buah gadangs or adding new citizens to existent buah gadangs to the panghulu since they were the nagari's political leaders. 

Difference between assemblies of suku and kaums/buah gadang
The suku can be considered a political assembly, which met fairly infrequently, usually for the purpose of electing a leader. The kaum and buah gadangs met for social and religious reasons in informal settings in addition to meeting formally for discussing more practical matters like agriculture.

- The debt/tribute known as hka owed to the agyi in the form of agricultural produce was much lower than in the gumlao than in the aristocratic gumsa. ""The scale of compensation did not vary with the rank of the villager"" (pg. 205, Leach)
- Even this hka was distributed equally between the agyi, bawmung and Council. The Council members then gave it away to the families/lineages in most need of surplus crop. This was done after an unbiased consultation between the Elders and members would frequently give their share of the crop to another lineage in need, indicating altruism and solidarity. 
- Therefore, while the tribute system was considered a ""feudal"" practise by Leach in the gumsa, it was an instance of redistribution in the gumlao. 

Lineages and marriages 
- ""ideally a gumlao is endogamous and consists of three or more lineages marrying in a circle, each lineage having equal rights"" (pg 205, Leach)

-  Each member of the Council of Elders is associated with a lineage/ethnic group, and thus different ethnic groups are represented through the same institution
