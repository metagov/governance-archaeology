'Each family creates ties which distribute its risk over the population and thereby assure that losses will be covered in bad years.' (Wiessner (1982), p. 66)

'The hxaro relationship involves a balanced, delayed exchange of gifts, whose continuous flow gives both partners information about the underlying status of the relationship - one of a bond of a friendship accompanied by mutual reciprocity and access to resources. In addition, each partnership links a person to a broad network of hxaro paths' (p. 66)",Inspiring principle of community life,

Village Founder-Leader (dzoma),Akha,,"Person with the highest authority in the village.
Responsible for:
-	Founding villages, initiating yearly household-based ancestor offerings, officiating at annual communal rites, adjudicating intravillage disputes, fining those who transgress Customs (e.g. adulterers) (Lewis 1968b; 1969-70:128-134) (Kammerer, p. 90-91)
-	The ceremonies led by the Village Founder-Leader primarily concern the welfare of the entire community. (Kammerer, p. 103)

""lead"" rather than ""rule"":
-	A better translation for “dzo” is “to lead” (Kammerer, p. 93)
-	It is his duty to follow Customs; he cannot impose his individual will upon villagers in his care (Kammerer, p. 93)

Requirements:
-	Must uphold Customs. However, expert knowledge of oral tradition and ritual procedures is not a prerequisite for office. (Kammerer, p. 95)
-	Must be “pure” or “clean”: his wife cannot have been pregnant at the time of their marriage and together they cannot ever have produced twins or deformed children. (Kammerer, p. 94)
-	A man must give up his position if he is no longer “clean”. (Kammerer, p. 94)
-	Qualifications: he is calm, impartial, and sincere man willing to listen to others who are better versed in the intricacies of Customs. (Kammerer, p. 95)

Succession: 
-	The office is not necessarily inherited. (Kammerer, p. 94)
-	A son, usually the youngest who remains behind in his parents’ household after his older brothers have established independent households, often succeeds his deceased father. 
-	Such succession, must however, be ratified by the male elders. (Kammerer, p. 94)
-	Male heads of families planning to form a new community may jointly nominate one among themselves or recruit another respected “clean” man to select the site and serves as Village Founder-Leader. (Kammerer, p. 94)

Extra:
-	The Village Founder-Leader’s life thus differs little from that of his neighbours, even though he is respected by virtue of his office. (Kammerer, p. 95)
-	The first house built (usually near the centre of the settlement) must be his (Grunfeld 1982:54; Lewis 1969-70:125-128; Lewis and Lewis 1984: 218) (Kammerer, p. 90)
-	“If there is no Founder-Leader (dzoma), a village cannot be built” (Kammerer, p. 90)
","Council of Elders:
-	Although dzoma does arbitrate disputes and impose fines, he does not do so alone. (p. 93)
-	Rather he does so in consultation with other male elders; his decision legitimises the consensus reached (p. 93)

-	Recitation of the ritual texts of the oral tradition is the essence of the office. (p. 100)
-	To become a Reciter a man must study with one or more Reciters. (p. 100)
-	During his apprenticeship he is known as p’iza “Apprentice Reciter”. (p. 100-101)
-	This position is achieved rather than inherited. (p. 101)
-	Requisitions: “clean” man who has the intelligence and perseverance required to memorise the vast corpus of ritual chants (p. 101)
-	He must provide his mentor with liquor and stipulated gifts, including a set of new clothes. (p. 101)
-	Although the office is not inherited, many men are taught by a patrilineal relative. In such cases the customary payment from a student to his teacher is not required. (p. 101)
-	Even a young Reciter spends few days, if any, working in his family’s fields. (p. 101)
-	Ceremonies led by the Reciter primarily concern the welfare of an individual or a patrilineal kin unit. 9p. 103)
-	The Reciter, unlike the Village Founder-Leader, has no official role in rituals of the annual cycle. (p. 103)
-	Although villagers prefer to have at least one Reciter among them, a community need not have a resident Reciter. (p. 103)

-	Some ethnographic accounts report that village disputes are settled by a “council of elders” (for example, Lewis and Lewis 1984:227).
-	Kammerer prefers to avoid this phrase because it conveys what she considers to be a false impression of formality, rigidity, and corporateness. (Kammerer, p. 118)
-	Every male head of patrilineal family should attend meetings called by the Village Founder-Leader. (Kammerer, p. 118)
-	Full attendance may not be realised, and an old man may well send a son in his stead.
-	Issues are discussed until a consensus is reached, and his consensus is validated by the Village Founder-Leader (Kammerer, p. 118-p. 119)

Chiefs often initiated the migration of a village and made a “political judgement about how much distance a community should put between itself and the state.” (pg. 317) because shifting cultivation meant that they were less likely to be state subjects. The village respected the chief's decision not because they were coerced into doing so but because they had a ""genuine admiration"" for his judgement. ",Head of the village. His authority rests on capacities and merit,
Village shaman ,Hmong villages,,"“a prominent woman or man, often a shaman, would have a dream telling her to move to a new place” which led to the formation of daughter villages, frequently led by the dreamer (Scott, pg. 490)
Shamans would also interpret the dreams of other people since they were believed to have a connection to the spiritual world and it was frequently upon their advice that dreamers decided to form new villages. ",Another figure of authority in the village,
Village gatherings,Hmong villages,Assembly (central),"These are not formal assemblies but gatherings of the village to make important decisions, including migrating.

Before moving to a new village, the male heads of all the families in the village assembled at the dwelling of the headman or the dreamer. The decision to migrate with the village (at the behest of the village chief) or break away from the village (following the shaman/prominent person who had a dream/supernatural indication) depended on the personal respect and trust a family had in the figure of authority suggesting it. In these informal assemblies, each family declared its position. Those families who would migrate then stayed on to discuss the logistics of the move.

	‘The omu, in her capacity as the head of the female side of the community, with her cabinet determined the rules and regulations under which the market – the domain of women – was to function. This included fixing prices for goods sold in the market and setting market prohibitions. The omu and her councillors presided over each market and acted as a court in judging cases and disciplining (largely through fines) any woman who broke the laws of the market.’ (49)
	‘The omu handled cases involving women that were brought to her from throughout the town. Men who had complaints against their wives that were beyond the competence of the family circle to deal with came to the omu to seek advice or redress. The omu gave advice to wives who sought it, and where she felt that she could not handle the situation herself, she and her cabinet sought the cooperation of the obi in council. Such cooperation in cases involving both sexes was the rule rather than the exception, especially in matters involving a man and his wife. Among the Igbo, arriving at a consensus on any major issue was vital. It was not enough for justice to be done; that such justice was done ought to be transparently clear to anybody.’ (50)
	‘The omu had direct responsibility for the institution of title-taking among women. Thus, if the omu had not acquired all the women’s titles of the community at the time of her nomination by the town oracle, her relatives rallied to help her secure them, since she could only encourage and perpetuate an institution of which she was fully a part.’ (50-51)
	‘The duty of the omu was to represent all the women of her community, and consequently she had to be very responsive to her constituency. Though the women of the community did not form a corporate body, the omu sought their cooperation in and approval of any major decisions through the institution called the ikporo ani.’ (51)","Stands next to the Obi,  summons the Ikporo Ani",

As daughters of the lineage, their social position was significantly higher than that of the inyemedi. The former had the acknowledged prerogative of addressing the latter as “our wives,” which in this patriarchal society indicated a lower status. The otu umuada could demand homage or duties from the out inyemedi, and they would be obliged to comply. Apparently a spirit of goodwill and “sweet rivalry” surrounded such demands.’ (52)

They were characterized as being 'saparuik' - 'of one womb.' 
Essentially, each buah gadang could trace a common ancestor and eventually split into kaums and then into suku. 
Thus, a buah gadang was also defined as a collection of the informal 'kaums' or groups. On average 3-4 kaums made a buah gadang (pg. 65)
Being a member of a buah gadang allowed the descendants of former slaves to acquire citizenship of the nagari. 

Land and agricultural produce were usually owned collectively by a kaum. In the case of disputed land between kaums, the buah gadang, which was made of kaums attempted to resolve it amicably.

-      The scalper, who was also a shaman, exemplified the connection between warfare and the Mohave ""racist"" philosophy in which non-contamination with foreign blood was always a primary consideration. (Fathauer, p. 108)
-	Warfare was a means of demonstrating tribal prowess and superiority to other tribes. (Fathauer, p. 109)
-	Thus the statuses of kwaxot and axwe satumac (scalper) formed the structural connections for three extremely important themes of Mohave life: warfare, sickness, and tribal continuity through fertility. (Fathauer, p. 109)
-	The scalper was also a tribal official, since only one man occupied this status at any one time. (Fathauer, p. 109)

-	The ultimate determinant of the statuses a man would occupy depended upon his dreams. (Fathauer, p. 110)
- Mohave warriors feared the magical potency of an enemy scalp; if a man should touch it he would go insane and ""holler in the night."" (Stewart, p. 269)
- Consequently, scalping was performed only by a special scalper, the ahwe somadj (""dream[er] of foes""), who was a shaman rather than a warrior, and who, provided he underwent purification, was unharmed by contact with the scalp. (Stewart, p. 269)
- The ahwe somadj, who dreamed his power to scalp, also doctored warriors who had fallen ill due to contact with the enemy. (Stewart, p. 269)

-	As indicated earlier in this paper, the chief was excluded from warlike activities. (Fathauer, p. 109)
-	This may not be an accurate reflection of aboriginal conditions. (Fathauer, p. 109)
-	The status of xanidal apparently did not exist prior to fairly extensive White contact.  (Fathauer, p. 109)
-	According to several informants, the first chief was chosen after the Whites came, when it became necessary to deal with them. (Fathauer, p. 109)
-	The status was fitted into the aboriginal pattern, but not completely, since, although the chief was supposed to dream his power, the office also became hereditary. (Fathauer, p. 109) 
-	The first chief was selected because he was ""lucky"" in his dealings with the Whites. (Fathauer, p. 109)
-	It appears probable that the status of chief represented an elaboration of the rather vaguely defined status of pataxan, local group leader. (Fathauer, p. 109)
-	The principal tribal status of religious leadership, kwaxot, declined in importance rapidly when the culture began to change under the impact of Whites. (Fathauer, p. 109)
-	The new status of chief lacked the connections with religion and war that characterized that of kwaxot, and appears to have been based upon the status of pataxan, or local group leader. (Fathauer, p. 110)

- Two or three men in the tribe ranked as head kwanamis or war chiefs, for whom there was no name other than kwanami.  (Stewart, p. 260)
- Like other kwanamis, they theoretically attained their positions through proper dreaming.  (Stewart, p. 260)
- Each war party was conducted by a head kwanami, whose powers were minimal and not clearly formulated, although he was not responsible to the tribal chief.  (Stewart, p. 260)
- The head kwanami acted as a leader and officer on the war party, and when the party approached an enemy camp he stopped the warriors and gave them instructions relative to the attack. (Stewart, p. 260)
- Several months often elapsed after the return of the scouts before a war party set out. (Stewart, p. 266)

- His purpose was down-to-earth: to obtain and distribute wealth. (Fletcher, p. 23)
- Great emphasis was placed on the quality of generosity. (Fletcher, p. 23)
- Even more basic was the quality of warrior and leader of men. (Fletcher, p. 23)
- As the head of a confederation, the ruler might not have to fight, but as autocrat of a steppe empire, the essential qualities were martial ones. (Fletcher, p. 23)
- An ""imperial"" khan had to lead his subjects to success on the field of battle and in the extortion of wealth from sedentary governments. (Fletcher, p. 23)

- So personal was this bond [between Khan and the tribal chief]-upon which the integrity of the steppe empire was based- that at the khan's death, unless his successor recreated the empire on a similar personal basis, the empire soon dissolved. (Fletcher, p. 23)
- In a steppe empire-as opposed to a confederation-the bond between the khan and the tribal chief was the bond between leader and follower, between general and regimental commander-but between the two men as persons not as offices (Fletcher, p. 23)

-  In a succession struggle, the rival candidates and their nokor competed for the support of the tribe's leading men and formed factions that could either compromise or fight. (Fletcher, p. 17-18)
-  Not just members of the chiefly lineage but also leaders of the tribe's noble clans not infrequently surrounded themselves with nokor and held a potential for usurping the chieftaincy or breaking away, taking their haran with them, and forming a new tribe. (Fletcher, p. 18)
-  Like the tribal chiefs and nobles, the supratribal ruler and all contestants for his office had personal retinues of nokor who served their master as his eyes and ears and hands-as military commanders, administrators, secret or public agents, and specialists of all kinds who formed the nucleus of what could become, if need be, an extended imperial administration. (Fletcher, p. 20)
- Nokor directed their master's personal guard-cum-household, being, as it were, his slaves and companions. (Fletcher, p. 20)
- They derived their power and authority exclusively from his
 person and might be recruited from any social origin, nomadic or sedentary, noble, commoner, or slave. (Fletcher, p. 20)
- But if they were noblemen, they were not likely to be tribal chiefs (although Chinggis Khan himself, after reaching a certain level of power, deviated from this pattern), inasmuch as the possession of an autonomous basis of power would make for an unreliable nokor.

Succession:
- Chosen from the chiefly lineage, which was dominant amongst the clans (Fletcher, p. 17)
- Choice of the tribal chief was, in a manner of speaking, electoral, being governed by the principle of tanistry (Fletcher, p. 17)
- Principle of tanistry held that the tribe should be led by the best qualified member of the chiefly house (Fletcher, p. 17)
- At the chief's death, in other words, the succession did not pass automatically, in accordance with any principle of seniority such as primogeniture, but rather was supposed to go to the most competent of the eligible heirs. (Fletcher, p. 17)
- Unless the tribe was very large, most tribal interests were usually best served by a timely resolution of the succession question, and the tribal leaders must ordinarily have managed to keep disruptions to a minimum. (Fletcher, p. 17)

- In a succession struggle, the rival candidates and their nokor competed for the support of the tribe's leading men and formed factions that could either compromise or fight. (Fletcher, p. 18)
- Nor were the rivals limited to the backing of members of their own tribe. If a tribe were part of a confederation, a given candidate might win the backing of the confederal ruler or other powerful elements within the confederation. (Fletcher, p. 18)
- Tribes or leading tribal families also commonly had special relationships with tribal (or even non-tribal) elements outside the confederation and sometimes even beyond the edges of the steppe. (Fletcher, p. 18)

Assembly Houses,Nebelivka,Assembly (local),"Nebelivka was divided into roughly fourteen Quarters. Each Quarter had at least one Assembly House. No single Quarter seemed to resemble any other Quarter in size or content. As such it seems that there was no centralization. Neighbours would come together in a localized, bottom-up decision-making process. There was a house, a neighbourhood, a Quarter and a city. The structure of the Assembly House also suggests that Nebelivka was not a hierarchical society ruled by elites as the Assembly Houses were bigger versions of the 'typical' Trypillia houses. 

- One of the key structuring elements of the Nebelivka plan is the series of larger-than-usual buildings provisionally termed ‘assembly houses’, on the assumption that these buildings were public places for meetings (Figure 1). (Chapman, p. 128)
- The judicious combination of as many of the multiple criteria as possible [see notes for the 8 criteria examples] has led to a preliminary partition of the Nebelivka mega-site into fourteen Quarters (Figure 1).
- It has been assumed that the location of single, paired, or groups of Assembly Houses was related to the structuring of domestic houses within the Quarters. (Chapman, p. 129)
- It follows, then, that the distance separating Assembly Houses in adjacent Quarters would signify locational regularities (or otherwise) in the overall planning of the Quarters. (Chapman, p. 129)
- This measure of the regularity of planning Quarters reveals a localized, bottom-up decision-making process rather than an overall ‘centralized planning’ that may have resulted in much more regular inter-Assembly Room spacing. (Chapman, p. 129)
- A basic analysis of some of the locational and dimensional ‘regularities’ found at Nebelivka shows how Quarters developed in such markedly different ways that no single Quarter resembled any other Quarter in size or content. (Chapman, p. 129)
- It is improbable that different partitioning of the mega-site would result in a different conclusion from this: namely, that the mega-site developed from the bottom-up within the overall constraints of the basic planning principles. (Chapman, p. 129)
- It is intriguing that such variability could have been produced within identical planning principles. (Chapman, p. 129)
- In short, the Nebelivka mega-structure is, in a sense, much more interesting than a ritual centre with all the trappings of a Late Neolithic temple (cf. Parţa: Lazarovici et al., 2001); it is a massive building with large versions of domestic features—‘mega-features’— but with few objects differentiating the building from ‘typical’ Trypillia houses. (Chapman, p. 127)
- Those expecting the architectural and artefactual reflections of a hierarchical society with elites ruling over thousands of inhabitants in a Trypillia mega-site will be disappointed. (Chapman, p. 127)
- The resultant interpretation of the Nebelivka mega-structure requires a much more subtle model of site depositional practices than we have so far managed to create. (Chapman, p. 127)
- We are left with a building of great size, with a strong element of internal spatial differentiation, but with very few special artefacts. (Chapman, p. 128) 
- There is still little doubt that this is a public building, where meetings, and even ceremonies, could have taken place. (Chapman, p. 128)
- The most obvious place for large meetings would have been the open central area, with its access to four major internal features—the podium, the fired clay bin, and the two largest Raised Areas. (Chapman, p. 128)
- In addition, there may have been access to a set of small drinking-cups at the East end of the central area. (Chapman, p. 128)
- But if those who attended the meetings brought their favourite objects with them, they seemed to have taken many of them away at the end of the ceremonies. (Chapman, p. 128)
- The strong impression at the end of the excavation was of a mega-structure which had imitated the fittings and features of a domestic house on a large scale, without differentiating the megastructure in an artefactual sense. (Chapman, p. 128)
- We can therefore conclude that Trypillia mega-structures did indeed materialize spatial differentiation without the additional elaboration of artefactual differentiation. (Chapman, p. 128)
- The results of the excavation of the Nebelivka mega-structure have interesting implications for our understanding of the question of Trypillia urbanism. (Chapman, p. 129)
- Rather than the creation of a completely new form of public buildings, with special functions materialized in dramatic, often monumental ways (e.g. the monumental temple complexes in the Late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age of southwest Asia (Matthews, 2009; Gates, 2011), Trypillian dwellers were content to reproduce their family houses en gros at certain strategic points of the settlement, with deposition on the same level as in family houses. (Chapman, p. 129)
- But the mega-structure was by no means the same as a ‘normal house’, especially in its paucity of food storage, production, heating, and cooking facilities. (Chapman, p. 129)
- Several principal features (e.g. podium, cruciform Raised Areas) of the mega-structure are also similar to the features well known from Trypillia houses—but the Nebelivka examples are much larger (the podium, the Raised Areas) and more numerous (the Raised Areas). (Chapman, p. 127)
- Preliminary research suggests that the fired clay bin, the largest Raised Area, and podium are the largest examples of their type so far known in the Trypillia culture. (Chapman, p. 127)
- It would appear that the basic elements of the Trypillia house have been borrowed and adapted to fit the great size of what remains a public building but one without the depositional characteristics of a ritual or administrative centre. (Chapman, p. 127)
- The layout of the rooms and internal features in both interpretations of the mega-structure does not fit any of the ‘typical’ domestic house layouts as defined by Chernovol (2012: figure 8.8). (Chapman, p. 127)
- The mega-structure would have been a monumental building, visible from several km on the South part of the micro-region. (Chapman, p. 127)
- Interpretation of the mega-structure: the architectural remains of the Nebelivka mega-structure, together with its associated artefact assemblage, pose an intriguing problem of interpretation. (Chapman, p. 125)
- Before our excavation, the teams shared an expectation of a large public building with a range of special finds, indicating some kind of administrative or ritual central place serving, at the very least, a cluster of houses in the South–East part of the mega-site. (Chapman, p. 125)
- The size of the structure is not in doubt and the excavated remains provided a close match to the 2009 geophysical plan. (Chapman, p. 125)
- However, there was only one part of the mega-structure with anything resembling monumental architectural features—the East threshold with possible monumental wall features (Chapman, p. 125)
- ... This means that anyone approaching the mega-structure from the East side would have been confronted by a 2 m±high wall, with a possibly monumental entrance at the top of a slope. (Chapman, p. 126)
- They would then have entered a loosely integrated structure which was partly roofed, partly open and with markedly different kinds of local ‘spaces’—large open areas, small open areas, larger ‘rooms’, smaller ‘rooms’, and ‘box rooms’. (Chapman, p. 126)
- The overall impression of the finds from the mega-structure is that there are few finds that differ greatly from the ‘typical’ Trypillia house assemblage. (Chapman, p. 126)
- The group of over twenty small fired clay cones is perhaps a sign of an administrative practice (Videiko, 1987: 32–33), but may also be interpreted as gaming pieces (Figure 20). (Chapman, p. 127)
- In general, there is little to make the mega-structure objects stand out from the typical artefact assemblage from a Trypillia house. (Chapman, p. 127)

Dadia,Negara Ubud,,"A kinship group of the noble houses. The leadership of the dadia (punggawas) passed from the father to the eldest son, which meant that younger sons frequently broke away from their paternal dadia and formed their own dadia, competing for control of land and resources, which led to political intrigues and schisms. A weak network of internal alliances held the dadia together, but it was made ineffective by constant infighting. ","Though villages were crosscut by tax obligations to different lords or perbekel, they generally fell under the control of a particular dadia. The weakness of this institution allowed for villages to exercise independence in governing themselves. ",
Perbekel,Negara Ubud,,"Lord. Each land-owning male owed taxes and specific obligations to a lord or perbekel. Perbekels had a large number of subjects ranging from different villages, but very little actual power to enforce or collect taxes. Thus, in practise, the only obligations each land-owner had to his perbekel were services for rituals and battles. 

Geertz argues that the feudal and perbekel system were fundamentally different despite having the same lord-subject relationship since Bali did not have fiefdoms within which the perbekel exercised control. In addition to being geographically dispersed, the perbekel had very little real authority and was merely a figurative head or 'stagehand' in the theatre state. ",Not specified,

Pharaoh,Egypt ,,"The main royal leader of Egypt.

- In Egyptian wisdom literature addressing the subject of kingship: the so-called Teaching for King Merikare (c. 1900BCE). The narrator, himself apparently a king, gives the following advice to a future ruler: 
- ""Ensure that you are followed on account of your good character. Contemptible is he who forcefully binds the land to himself."" (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- This highlighting of the need to govern on the basis of popular support rather than brute force is then further elaborated on with specific reference to a conciliar form of government :
- ""Great is the great man whose great men are great, strong is the king who has councillors, wealthy is he who is rich in his nobles."" (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Moreover, in order to extract the most from his relationship with these influential subordinates, Pharaoh is advised to:
- ""Be skilled in speech, hence being strong, for the power of a king is his tongue. Speech is mightier than any combat."" (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- In these lines, the text expresses a fundamental truth about the nature of pharaonic government: while Pharaoh held office by divine right, the authority vested in the office was at its most effective only when Pharaoh ruled by consent, taking appropriate counsel and using powers of verbal persuasion to justify executive action. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- This chapter will consider the ways in which political discussions of this sort could take place, first by explicitly addressing the relationship between Pharaoh and his entourage, and subsequently moving on to explore other types of assemblies with capacity for decision-making. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
 - ... such texts, while varied in the events they describe, all conform to a fairly rigid overarching structure: Pharaoh announces a major undertaking, he discusses it with his courtiers, and the decision stemming therefrom then leads to Pharaoh’s triumph and the glory of Egypt. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- In a similar vein, a military inscription of Ramesses II also reveals a process of collective decision-making (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Thus, as a result of consultation with his subjects, Pharaoh could make decisions with important military and diplomatic consequences. (Alex Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- However, discussion was by no means limited to military matters and foreign affairs. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- For instance, the Prophecy of Neferti (c. 2000BCE), a narrative about a wise Pharaoh who invites a sage to tell him the future of the realm, starts with a description of routine business at the royal court. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- The impression given here is that Pharaoh held daily audiences with his assembled courtiers, and that the aim of this extended beyond simply being a ceremonial affirmation of royal power. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- In this example, Pharaoh is struck by an idea after the initial audience, and so calls the courtiers back for advice – which serves as the narrative device leading to the sage being invited. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- In another example, now known as the Building Inscription of Senusret I (c. 1950BCE), Pharaoh consults his courtiers before ordering a major construction project. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Likewise, discussion with courtiers seems to have also been required when Pharaoh was dealing with family matters – perhaps because of the potential implications this might have for the royal succession. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Thus, again the Pharaoh is shown to be conducting affairs of state with the assent of those around him. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Part of the story [Tale of Sinuhe (c. 2000BCE)] involves an Egyptian living abroad discussing the mechanisms by which Pharaoh rules Egypt, it being said that :
- ""He is the lord of graciousness, great of sweetness – he conquers by love. His city loves him more than its own self, and they rejoice for him more than for (any) god of theirs. The husbands and wives delight in him.""  (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Overall, the examples above therefore reveal that inclusive governance was present even at the very apex of political power in Ancient Egypt, it often being ingrained into the decision-making process of Pharaoh himself. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Given the limited nature of the evidence, it remains difficult to determine whether such consultation actually carried decisive political weight or served predominantly as a symbolic act of popular affirmation of predetermined royal policy. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Nonetheless, its very presence is highly significant, pointing to a clear need for Pharaoh to consult his people to generate legitimacy. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)","Consulted with the Courtiers of the Royal Court

2. The Vizier as Head of the Civil Administration
The basic concept underlying the vizier's control over the civil administration appears to entail three interdependent notions,  
1.	viz. justice,  
2.	operational control 
3.	appointment of civil servants. (van den Boorn, p. 315)
   2.1 Justice
-	The juridical tasks of the Vizier with regard to the civil administration can be divided into those pertaining to civil servants in a personal capacity and those dealing with civil servants in their official capacity. (van den Boorn, p. 315)
-	Civil servants are the sole concern of the vizier when they commit, crimes, abuses or simple mistakes outside their strictly official capacity (at least without direct reference to their official capacity.) (van den Boorn, p. 315)
-	Civil servants committing crimes, abuses or culpable acts in their official capacity are dealt with initially in section 6. When doubts arise concerning. someone's performance of his official duty,·· the vizier hears him and gives him the opportunity to exculpate himself. (van den Boorn, p. 316)
- If he is unable to do so, the man and his deeds are entered on the criminal register in the ""great prison"". (van den Boorn, p. 316)
In other words, an official has a record of his official derelictions kept. (van den Boorn, p. 316)
- Should derelictions recur, this record of past conduct forms part of the juridical assessment of the new offence. (van den Boorn, p. 316)
- The record plus a verbal report on the former offence(s) are to be handed over to the vizier. (van den Boorn, p. 316)
   2.2 Operational Control
-	The text makes a distinction between the vizier's operational control over departments (h3w) and over civil servants as functionaries. (van den Boorn, p. 317)
-	Thus, we are facing a distinction between an amorphous group of departments on a central level (in the residence-city) and clearly defined officials/echelons on a local level of administration. (van den Boorn, p. 317)
                          Control over Departments (Central Level):
-	In the vizier's operational control over departments a crucial role is played by the hnrt wr, ""the great prison"" and its sdmw ""hearers"",(section 7).  (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	Detailed procedures regulate the processing of information on the departments. (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	They ensure that the vizier is informed of and has ultimate control over ongoing business. (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	Data on departments are processed in the form of provisional documents drawn up by scribes of the hnrt wr.

-	These officials, with powers delegated by the vizier, operate a system of bureaucratic control over the work and activities of departments. (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-       The departments operate in a relatively independent fashion and are only checked by the vizier through a post factum control. (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	Thus, on the central level of administration, the heads of h3w-departments have a considerable freedom of action (except for the dispensation of Justice to departmental officials, which is the direct and sole concern of the vizier, cf. section 4). (van den Boorn, p. 318)

-	All local magistracies are obliged to report every four months on their accomplishments (section 13). (van den Boorn, p. 319)
-	Councillors of the district report to him their affairs (section 9), and urban authorities report on the state of security (section 17). (van den Boorn, p. 319)
-	What is remarkable is that these reports generally seem to postdate the reported activities (sections 9, 13 and 17). (van den Boorn, p. 319)
-	Only two fields of interest are exempt from this rule, viz. the agricultural and hydraulic tasks of the urban authorities and the councillors of the district (section 16). (van den Boorn, p. 319)
-	Here the vizier takes a direct interest in dispatching the officials with the appropriate instructions. (van den Boorn, p. 319)
-	It is evidently an interest of basic importance to the central administration. (van den Boorn, p. 319)
-	In general it would seem that the local administration functioned with a certain degree of independence. (van den Boorn, p. 319)
-	As in the case of the central departments, the vizier keeps a sort of ""distant control"", not by using an intermediary body, but by procedures mitigating - as it were - an all too direct control over the system. (van den Boorn, p. 319)
-	With the means of communications available around 1500 B.C in a country of the size of Egypt, any attempt to regulate a system of local administration centrally and in the greatest detail would have rendered the system hopelessly inefficient, to say the least. (van den Boorn, p. 320)
   2.3 Appointment of Civil Servants
-	In section 13 the vizier is said to be in charge of the appointment of the nty m srwt in his own area of competence. (van den Boorn, p. 320)
-	As we have argued, the term is a collective designation of the leading members of the main magistracies in the local administration. (van den Boorn, p. 320)
-	The term covers the urban authorities, the overseers of fields and the councillors of the district. (van den Boorn, p. 320)
-	The only other civil servants the vizier is said to appoint are stationed in the pr-nsw, viz. 'ryt-personnel(section 19) and the overseer of police(men) (section 17; cf. chapter 3.2.1 above). (van den Boorn, p. 320)
-	Thus, we are confronted with the interesting phenomenon of the vizier appointing the leading local officials and (at least part of) the pr-nsw-personnel, while the text is silent on the appointment of personnel to central departments. (van den Boorn, p. 320)
-	An explanation offers itself when we accept that this particular task belongs to the supervision of the departments by the hnrt wr. (van den Boorn, p. 320)
-	The vizier delegates the task to an extension of his own bureaucratic apparatus, for which reason The Duties makes no mention of it. (van den Boorn, p. 320)
-	An alternative that may come closer to historical reality, is that this task was in fact delegated to the heads of the h3w concerned, and was supervised by the ""great prison"". (van den Boorn, p. 320)

RA notes:
A Local Council run by local notables, priests and a local mayor that became the dominant form of local council under the New Kingdom despite existing previously as well. It, however, did not have as much authority as the Royal Court just like Djadjat so it was not able to impose corporal punishment such as mutilation. 

- Moving into the New Kingdom, a new council gained prominence: the qenbet, or ‘men of the angle’. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- This body had began life far earlier, with the first attestation dating back to a text of c. 2100BCE, the term originally referring to an obscure body of notables on whom a local potentate could call when he needed advice. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Until the onset of the New Kingdom, mentions of this term are few and far between, with djadjat being the standard term for a local council capable of making decisions. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- However, by the New Kingdom, the qenbet had become the dominant form of council and rules were laid down determining who was entitled to sit on it. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- The Pharaoh Horemheb (c. 1300BCE) issued a decree with the following provision :
- ""It is the high priests of the shrines, the mayors of the interior of this land , and the priests of the gods who are to make up any qenbet."" (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- The definition is nevertheless vague: no indication is given as to the number of people expected to sit on a qenbet, nor is it obvious whether the stipulations refer to absolutely any qenbet in Egypt, or merely any qenbet qualified to discuss and assess the provisions of the Horemheb decree. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- The latter ultimately appears more likely, as there is extensive evidence of individuals not belonging to any of the stated categories having membership of a qenbet – albeit a qenbet at village level, which was probably not senior enough to warrant the attention of Horemheb in his royal decree.

--- Qenbet in action through the Tomb Robbery Papyri---

Pesiur = the mayor of the city of Thebes 
☼	alleged the violation of the tomb of Amenophis I 
☼	accused the coppersmith Peikhal and his two fellow workers of making thefts in the Place of Beauty i. e. in the valley now known as the Tombs of the Queens 
☼	accused Amenpnufer in violation of the pyramid of Sebkemsaf 
☼	(it may well be, indeed, that all the royal tombs subsequently examined by the commission were specified in the charges laid by Pesiur before the vizier 

Reason…
-	Perhaps he felt that his official position was jeopardized by the open scandal of the tomb-robberies going on so near the seat of his authority. 
-	Conceivably also he was actuated by personal hostility to Pwerco, who was mayor of the west of Thebes where the necropolis lay. 
-	Or else, lastly, genuine indignation at the outrages and loyalty towards the absent Pharaoh may have been his inspiration

Great Tribunal/’the Great Notables’ members
-	Mayor --- Pesiur (the mayor was ex officio a member)
-	Vizier --- Vizier Khaemwese represented justice in the abstract
-	Royal Butlers --- Royal butlers Nasamun and Nefereremperamun may have owed their places on the courtto their close connection with the king
-	High Priest --- At the sessions on the 21st and 22nd, Amenhotpe, the high priest of Amun, was another prominent member yielding precedence only to the vizier
-	Representatives of the army and the navy --- Representatives of the army and the navy were, together with 
-	Second Priest of Amun --- the second priest of Amun, the remaining officialsconstituting the body usually referred to as ‘the Great Notables’.

Unhappy with Great Tribunal, Pesiur (mayor) cast a reflection on the fairness of the Great Tribunal by swearing that he would appeal to Pharaoh over its head.

The mayor Pesiur, though himself a member of the court, was found in the wrong.
…
At the end of the trial he and several others were surrendered to the high-priest until instructions should come from Pharaoh as to their punishment.
This seems to have been by virtue of old and humane law according to which Pharaoh alone had the right to authorise a criminal’s death or mutilation.

RA notes:
Probably without any royal oversight, run by Local Notables and concerned with local government, administration and legal proceedings. In the religious sense, it was also a venue for judging the deceased. Djadjat, however, did not have as much authority as the the Royal Court, so it was not able to impose corporal punishment such as mutilation. Djadjat was the dominant council capable of making decisions under the Old and Middle Kingdom. By the time of the New Kingdom, Qenbet became more significant. 

- The oldest Egyptian term for a council – or at least some sort of gathering of notables – is the djadjat (‘the men of the circle’); a term which in origin most likely denoted the circle of people who came together to discuss the affairs of their local community, probably without any royal oversight. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- In the case on an Old Kingdom stela concerned with the sale of a house in Giza (c. 2300BCE), it appears that djadjat played a judicial role in validating property transactions. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- The presence of the buyer, seller, and witnesses before the djadjat suggests a modus operandi resembling a court of law, although the procedure here is merely of legal affirmation rather than the settlement of any dispute. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- One tablet (c. 2200BCE) reveals that the djadjat was responsible for managing logistical matters, such as booking the arrival of potters for local officials. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Others, written in a similar style, allude to the djadjat being involved in the organisation of agriculture, tax collection and procurement of labour for construction projects. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Indeed, the presence of a djadjat seems to have been a marker of a viable, well-run community, so much so that Old Kingdom religious texts already refer to the supernatural community of the gods having its own djadjat.  (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Thus, leading figures in the state administration, such as the sole companion of the king Tjay (c. 2450BCE), the vizier Kagemni (c. 2300BCE) and the royal overseer of works Ity (c. 2300BCE), allude to how they expect the divine djadjat to intercede on their behalf against anyone who might wish to violate their tombs. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- In the Middle Kingdom, the djadjat continued in a very similar role.  (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- The most detailed example of its activity is recorded in Papyrus Berlin 10470 (c. 1650BCE), which describes in remarkable detail how the local djadjat of the city of Elephantine considered what seems a fairly low-level request to alter the working arrangements of a single female servant named Senbet.  (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- The process can be broken down into the following steps :
1.	Initial appeal to the herald of Elephantine , asking him to consider the transfer of Senbet from combined public and private service (working jointly for the city of Elephantine and a private master) to full-time service to a different private master.
2.	Herald decrees that the permission of all parties involved is necessary for the transfer to go ahead, and that approval of the royal palace, represented by the vizier, must also be sought.

8.	Document confirming the completion of the procedure is drawn up and passed to the local djadjat for final approval and archiving. Senbet can start service for her new master. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- This procedure, while undoubtedly bureaucratic and cumbersome, indicates a high level of inclusivity in local governance – the state was not simply prepared to re-assign a servant from one domain to another, but deemed it necessary to consult all parties with a view to achieving the satisfaction of each. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- There is ample evidence for the Middle Kingdom djadjat having an extensive record-keeping staff, with the title ‘scribe of the djadjat’ becoming common and many holders of this title possessing their own seals .  (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- The presence of a dedicated bureaucracy is consistent would be consistent with the institution regularly needing to handle complex tasks of the sort outlined above.  (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Much like in the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom djadjat also continued to be involved in various other spheres of activity connected to local government and administration, such as building boats , supplying grain , managing convict labourers  and maintaining good order in the temples .  (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- It is highly significant that all these diverse activities were therefore run by a council, indicative of some degree of inclusive governance, and not by a single appointed official as one might expect in a top-down, strictly hierarchical political system.  (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)


Old Kingdom:
-	These texts clearly indicate that the djadjat could be a venue for quite complex legal proceedings, involving oaths, witnesses, messengers, and transfer of property. (Alex Loktionov, PhD, p. 82)
-	In the religious literature of the period, it is also a venue for judging the deceased (Goedicke 1963: 340) 66. (Alex Loktionov, PhD, p.82)
-	However, it is striking that it is attested so rarely in title strings, and that the attestations which do exist invariably have close ties to scribal bureaucracy. (Alex Loktionov, PhD, p. 83)
-	One possibility might be that the djadjat, designating a group of people rather than any specific location, was in fact a far more common and informal outlet for daily justice than its more elite and hence better documented counterparts like the wsh.t or hw.t-wr.t 67. (Alex Loktionov, PhD, p. 83)
-	It may have operated at a lower level along oral-aural lines, adjudicating between people who did not regularly produce texts, convening outside the temple setting or the realm of royal administration, and only appearing in the written record on the rare occasions when scribal involvement did prove necessary.  (Alex Loktionov, PhD, p. 83)
-	If so, it may have resembled the customary village assemblies prevalent in traditional societies in sub-Saharan Africa, as discussed in the ethnographic overview in the previous chapter68. (Alex Loktionov, PhD, p. 83)

Middle Kingdom:
-	Overall, it therefore seems highly likely that in the Middle Kingdom the djadjat was an administrative body with a wide remit, with justice being one component among many. (Alex Loktionov, PhD, p. 113)
-	By this time it might in certain cases have developed a more rigid structure with a permanent or semi-permanent staff, and could be associated with high officials. (Alex PhD, p. 113)
-	However, the presence of regional, less formal djadjat-courts naturally cannot be excluded and indeed seems highly probable. (Alex Loktionov, PhD, p. 113)
-	It is noteworthy that, despite its relative prominence, there is not a single attestation of the djadjat in the title strings of Middle Kingdom officials involved in sdm – this may suggest that its participation in justice was still largely based on informal methods.

- The gods were served by priests, of different grades and functions. (Rice, xxxvi)
- In the early centuries all Egyptians of standing were expected to serve as priests in the temples, for an agreed period each year; this represented more of a social obligation than evidence of a religious vocation. (Rice, xxxvi)
- Later, as the perquisites of the temple hierarchies grew, the priesthood became increasingly professional. (Rice, xxxvi)
- Many of the most rewarding of the temple benefices became hereditary fiefs. (Rice, xxxvi)
- Nonetheless, the king was notionally the High Priest of every cult, the temple priests merely his surrogates. (Rice, xxxvi)
- However, each major temple community was directed by High Priest whose power was often very great. (Rice, xxxvi)
- Some of the High Priesthoods, such as that of Ptah of Memphis, Re of Heliopolis and Amun of Thebes  were the greatest political figures in the state; eventually, the power of some of them was to rival, if it did not exceed, the power of the kings. (Rice, xxxvi)

- This last category of scribe might well be a priest, serving the god in a particular capacity and occupying a place in the intensely hierarchic gradings of temple personnel. (Rice, lvi)
- These ranged from the High Priest, who presided over the entire concerns of the temple, which in some cases came in time to rival the power of the king himself; the Second, Third and Fourth Prophets, who were the senior clergy of the Temple; and to minor functionaries who, though their duties might be quite humble—cleaning the temple for example or ensuring that the god’s clothes or daily rations were in order— nonetheless valued highly their employment in the temple, which provided an absolute security for life.

-	The documents are the result of inquiries carried out by hearers (sdmw of the hnrt wr). (van den Boorn, p. 318)

-	Two points are of particular interest. (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	The hearing or inquiry by the hearers and the ensuing inspection of the relevant documents by the vizier appear to postdate the actual activity of the department. (van den Boorn, p. 318)
