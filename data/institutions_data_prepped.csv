(e) They facilitate mobility between visiting groups because hierarchies do not mesh easily. Egalitarian institutions vary in how encompassing they are, that is, whether they include adults of both sexes and all ages, and whether equality applies to both opportunity and outcome (Flanagan 1989; Robbins 1994).

Responsible for:
-	Founding villages, initiating yearly household-based ancestor offerings, officiating at annual communal rites, adjudicating intravillage disputes, fining those who transgress Customs (e.g. adulterers) (Lewis 1968b; 1969-70:128-134) (Kammerer, p. 90-91)
-	The ceremonies led by the Village Founder-Leader primarily concern the welfare of the entire community. (Kammerer, p. 103)

""lead"" rather than ""rule"":
-	A better translation for “dzo” is “to lead” (Kammerer, p. 93)
-	It is his duty to follow Customs; he cannot impose his individual will upon villagers in his care (Kammerer, p. 93)

Requirements:
-	Must uphold Customs. However, expert knowledge of oral tradition and ritual procedures is not a prerequisite for office. (Kammerer, p. 95)
-	Must be “pure” or “clean”: his wife cannot have been pregnant at the time of their marriage and together they cannot ever have produced twins or deformed children. (Kammerer, p. 94)
-	A man must give up his position if he is no longer “clean”. (Kammerer, p. 94)
-	Qualifications: he is calm, impartial, and sincere man willing to listen to others who are better versed in the intricacies of Customs. (Kammerer, p. 95)

Succession: 
-	The office is not necessarily inherited. (Kammerer, p. 94)
-	A son, usually the youngest who remains behind in his parents’ household after his older brothers have established independent households, often succeeds his deceased father. 
-	Such succession, must however, be ratified by the male elders. (Kammerer, p. 94)
-	Male heads of families planning to form a new community may jointly nominate one among themselves or recruit another respected “clean” man to select the site and serves as Village Founder-Leader. (Kammerer, p. 94)

Extra:
-	The Village Founder-Leader’s life thus differs little from that of his neighbours, even though he is respected by virtue of his office. (Kammerer, p. 95)
-	The first house built (usually near the centre of the settlement) must be his (Grunfeld 1982:54; Lewis 1969-70:125-128; Lewis and Lewis 1984: 218) (Kammerer, p. 90)
-	“If there is no Founder-Leader (dzoma), a village cannot be built” (Kammerer, p. 90)
","Council of Elders:
-	Although dzoma does arbitrate disputes and impose fines, he does not do so alone. (p. 93)
-	Rather he does so in consultation with other male elders; his decision legitimises the consensus reached (p. 93)

-	Leads the various purification rites following a “bad death” (p. 103)
-	Enact ceremonies to re-establish order after the birth of twins or a malformed child. (p. 103)
-	Nevertheless, neither birth nor marriage rituals are his province. (p. 104)

-	Recitation of the ritual texts of the oral tradition is the essence of the office. (p. 100)
-	To become a Reciter a man must study with one or more Reciters. (p. 100)
-	During his apprenticeship he is known as p’iza “Apprentice Reciter”. (p. 100-101)
-	This position is achieved rather than inherited. (p. 101)
-	Requisitions: “clean” man who has the intelligence and perseverance required to memorise the vast corpus of ritual chants (p. 101)
-	He must provide his mentor with liquor and stipulated gifts, including a set of new clothes. (p. 101)
-	Although the office is not inherited, many men are taught by a patrilineal relative. In such cases the customary payment from a student to his teacher is not required. (p. 101)
-	Even a young Reciter spends few days, if any, working in his family’s fields. (p. 101)
-	Ceremonies led by the Reciter primarily concern the welfare of an individual or a patrilineal kin unit. 9p. 103)
-	The Reciter, unlike the Village Founder-Leader, has no official role in rituals of the annual cycle. (p. 103)

In addition to belonging to a deme, citizens were associated with one of ten new artificially created “tribes” that now each sent 50 individuals, selected by lot, to a Council of 500 that would administer the day-to-day affairs of the city.' (p. 32)

From 462 BCE, even the lower classes, thetes, could hold office

'The Greek city-states for the most part failed to establish command-and-control bureaucracies. Nor did the Greek world develop an integrated master social or theological narrative that would have provided ideological support for the necessity of individual obedience to central authority' (Ober, Josiah (2015), p. 60)

'quasi-federal institutional reforms in the aftermath of a democratic revolution (ch. 7). Federalism was widely adopted in mainland Greece in the fourth century BCE (ch. 9). Federalist and quasi-federalist institutional experiments allowed Greek states to operate as extensive “networks of social networks”—and thereby contributed to solving the problem of monitoring and punishing free riders.' (p. 68)

Community rewards to those 'who lead efforts to punish malefactors.' (p. 68)

'Under Cleisthenes’ reformed constitutional order, 139 villages, towns, and neighborhoods of Attica were designated “demes.” An average deme had a free adult male population of 150– ­250, although some were smaller, and others, notably Aphidna and Acharnai, much larger.' (Ober, Josiah (2015), p. 162)

'Each Athenian was thus treated as a citizen at different levels: locally in his deme and at the federal level of the polis. All free adult males resident in Attica in the year of the reform were, in the immediate aftermath of the revolution, considered to be citizens of Athens and of their deme of residence. Moreover, the deme would hereafter be the fundamental unit of Athenian citizenship: To be a citizen of Athens, a male resident of Attica must be formally recognized by an assembly of citizens in his deme as having been born to an Athenian father who was himself a citizen of the deme, and as being at least 18 years of age.' (p. 162-4)

'Two intermediate levels of belonging connected the demes to the federal state. Citizens of each deme were assigned to one of ten newly created artificial “tribes.” Each tribe enrolled roughly a tenth of the citizens, drawn from three distinct regions of Attica.' (p. 164)

'Perhaps most importantly, the membership of the new central state Council of 500, which conducted Athens’ day-­ to-­ day public affairs and set the agenda for the legislative citizen assembly, was recruited through the new deme/tribe system. In later years, at least, councilors were aged 30 and older, were chosen by lot, and were paid for their service. Each of the 10 tribes annually provided 50 councilors. The members of each tribal contingent of 50 were chosen at the deme level, each deme sending a certain number of councilors according to population.' (p. 164)

'But Cleisthenes had not introduced to Athens what we think of today as “representative government” because councilors were not expected to represent the particularistic interests of their deme, regional third, or tribe. Nor were they accountable to local voters. Rather, the councilors served, collectively, as a microcosm of the Athenian citizenry. They represented what, in the aggregate, the Athenian people knew and the skills and information the Athenians could bring to bear on problems confronting the state.' (p. 164)

Areopagus
- 'membership was drawn from ex-­magistrates' (p. 166)

'The Athenian citizenry elected their military leaders; many other state officials were, however, chosen by lottery. All officials, elected or lotteried, were subject to ex ante public scrutiny and held publicly accountable, on an annual basis, for their performance.' (p. 168)

'Each year, the Athenian assembly decided whether to conduct an ostracism; if the decision was positive (as it was only 15 recorded times in Athenian history), the citizenry chose, by plurality written ballot, which prominent member of the Athenian elite to expel from the community for 10 years.' (p. 168)

The Council met almost daily, whilst the Assembly met four times each month

'The Solonian people’s court was subdivided into a number of courts, so that many more cases could now be judged by panels of citizens, chosen by lottery.' (p. 168)

'Federalism enabled trust among citizens, arising from local interactions at the deme level, to be leveraged at the level of the tribe and then at the level of the polis.' (p. 170)

'The deme-­tribe-­polis federal system helped to make the mass meetings of the Athenian assembly both less daunting and less clientalistic, as ordinary citizens developed social networks that extended at least to the tribe level.' (p. 171)

'Athenian citizens proved to be quite good at identifying and attending to experts and quite capable of using the knowledge of experts for the ends of policy-­ making without turning state management over to them.'

'Under Cleisthenes’ reformed constitutional order, 139 villages, towns, and neighborhoods of Attica were designated “demes.” An average deme had a free adult male population of 150– ­250, although some were smaller, and others, notably Aphidna and Acharnai, much larger.' (Ober, Josiah (2015), p. 162)

'Each Athenian was thus treated as a citizen at different levels: locally in his deme and at the federal level of the polis. All free adult males resident in Attica in the year of the reform were, in the immediate aftermath of the revolution, considered to be citizens of Athens and of their deme of residence. Moreover, the deme would hereafter be the fundamental unit of Athenian citizenship: To be a citizen of Athens, a male resident of Attica must be formally recognized by an assembly of citizens in his deme as having been born to an Athenian father who was himself a citizen of the deme, and as being at least 18 years of age.' (p. 162-4)

'Two intermediate levels of belonging connected the demes to the federal state. Citizens of each deme were assigned to one of ten newly created artificial “tribes.” Each tribe enrolled roughly a tenth of the citizens, drawn from three distinct regions of Attica.' (p. 164)

'Perhaps most importantly, the membership of the new central state Council of 500, which conducted Athens’ day-­ to-­ day public affairs and set the agenda for the legislative citizen assembly, was recruited through the new deme/tribe system. In later years, at least, councilors were aged 30 and older, were chosen by lot, and were paid for their service. Each of the 10 tribes annually provided 50 councilors. The members of each tribal contingent of 50 were chosen at the deme level, each deme sending a certain number of councilors according to population.' (p. 164)

'But Cleisthenes had not introduced to Athens what we think of today as “representative government” because councilors were not expected to represent the particularistic interests of their deme, regional third, or tribe. Nor were they accountable to local voters. Rather, the councilors served, collectively, as a microcosm of the Athenian citizenry. They represented what, in the aggregate, the Athenian people knew and the skills and information the Athenians could bring to bear on problems confronting the state.' (p. 164)

Later on there was a kind of representative body that was able to enforce its will in certain issues, for instance regarding the appointment of military leaders, but there was probably no democratic governance with voting rights for the population.' (p. 14)

'The priesthood in Carthage was reserved for males of the aristocracy and was hereditary. The chief of the priests or rab kohanim, besides his important religious role, also exercised great influence over the workings of the State and economic life' (p. 41)

'Although the monarchy was certainly not hereditary, the most important positions were reserved for the members of certain families, which had the effect of creating dynasties.' (p. 42)

In the 4th ce. BC, Carthage became an aristocratic republic with a king, the 'Council of Elders' (similar to the Roman senate), the 'Tribunal of 104', and the 'ham', a parliamentary assembly

'From the late fourth century BC onwards, Carthage was governed by two annually–elected suffetes, similar to Roman consuls, and the parliamentary assembly also appears to have increased in importance.' (p. 42)

Population numbers: ""This urban region would have had a population of 5,000 to 8,000 in the seventh century BC, which is very large in the context of ancient civilisations. By the second century BC this figure had grown to at least 50,000, if not 100,000, and even 300,000 is mentioned."" (p.30)

Contrary to previous scholarship, Reynolds advocates for a similarity of social and political institutions across Europe (p. 7-8)

""Early medieval government, then, was in its own way both
constitutional and representative: constitutional because
kings were supposed to be limited by law, custom and consultation; and representative, firstly because the king made
and declared law as the supreme representative of his people,
and secondly because those with whom he was supposed to
consult were themselves representative. The bishops and
nobles of a kingdom, like the senior and richer landowners of
a province or village, were, in the terms of the time, those
who were qualified to speak on behalf of the collectivity of
which they were the most solid, respectable, and responsible
members."" p. 22

CH 1: LAW
Like in anglo saxon England, ""assemblies"" dealt with legal and legislative matters. In the communes, assemblies' judicial functions included judgment as well as arbitration and mediation. (p. 25)

Assemblies were presided by a president, either the king himself or a representative. Judges could be elites (scabini), iudices, or laymen, and could be appointed by the president or include all the present. Variation depended on the circumstances of the case.

Collective judgment did not apply to unfree peasants (judged by their lord) and cases in which a single judge is in charge (possibly, for more esoteric judgment having to do with roman law). (p 31-2)

judgments were sworn (p.33)

Evolution over time: ""There can be no doubt that the twelfth and thirteenth centuries began to bring important changes to the ideas and practices of law. The strengthening of government began to transform the law by emphasizing one source of its authority and enforcement among others. More and more crimes came to incur formal punishments, inflicted by the authority of the ruler, instead of being left to mutual negotiation by feud and wergeld. Although in practice the maintenance of law and order still depended in large measure on collective self-policing, it was now the king’s (or sometimes the count’s or duke’s) peace which the law-breaker broke. The old amorphous assemblies were replaced by something more like modern law-courts, working within something more like
defined jurisdictions, and these gradually began to be organized into hierarchies of superior and inferior authority.’ Meanwhile the keeping of records reduced the flexibility of
custom at the same time that the increasing pace of secular
legislation, combined with religious reform and the extension
of papal jurisdiction, started to cast doubt on its inherent
validity. (p. 39)

CH 6 URBAN POLITICS
Assemblies were a fact of life (p. 164), likely to be meeting regularly (p. 167). 

The chapter focuses overwhelmingly on the later period and on cities already present in the database either individually (like Pisa, Genoa, Venice etc) or as a group (imperial and free town of the holy roman empire). Whereas forms of autonomous governance also continued both in France (local mayors) and England (see entry for anglo-saxon England), monarchical presence seems to have been stronger here than in italy and germany.

To be distinguished from (later) independent city-states and free cities in Italy and Germany.

Contrary to previous scholarship, Reynolds advocates for a similarity of social and political institutions across Europe (p. 7-8)

""Early medieval government, then, was in its own way both
constitutional and representative: constitutional because
kings were supposed to be limited by law, custom and consultation; and representative, firstly because the king made
and declared law as the supreme representative of his people,
and secondly because those with whom he was supposed to
consult were themselves representative. The bishops and
nobles of a kingdom, like the senior and richer landowners of
a province or village, were, in the terms of the time, those
who were qualified to speak on behalf of the collectivity of
which they were the most solid, respectable, and responsible
members."" p. 22

CH 1: LAW
Like in anglo saxon England, ""assemblies"" dealt with legal and legislative matters. In the communes, assemblies' judicial functions included judgment as well as arbitration and mediation. (p. 25)

Assemblies were presided by a president, either the king himself or a representative. Judges could be elites (scabini), iudices, or laymen, and could be appointed by the president or include all the present. Variation depended on the circumstances of the case.

Collective judgment did not apply to unfree peasants (judged by their lord) and cases in which a single judge is in charge (possibly, for more esoteric judgment having to do with roman law). (p 31-2)

judgments were sworn (p.33)

Evolution over time: ""There can be no doubt that the twelfth and thirteenth centuries began to bring important changes to the ideas and practices of law. The strengthening of government began to transform the law by emphasizing one source of its authority and enforcement among others. More and more crimes came to incur formal punishments, inflicted by the authority of the ruler, instead of being left to mutual negotiation by feud and wergeld. Although in practice the maintenance of law and order still depended in large measure on collective self-policing, it was now the king’s (or sometimes the count’s or duke’s) peace which the law-breaker broke. The old amorphous assemblies were replaced by something more like modern law-courts, working within something more like
defined jurisdictions, and these gradually began to be organized into hierarchies of superior and inferior authority.’ Meanwhile the keeping of records reduced the flexibility of
custom at the same time that the increasing pace of secular
legislation, combined with religious reform and the extension
of papal jurisdiction, started to cast doubt on its inherent
validity. (p. 39)

CH 6 URBAN POLITICS
Assemblies were a fact of life (p. 164), likely to be meeting regularly (p. 167). 

The chapter focuses overwhelmingly on the later period and on cities already present in the database either individually (like Pisa, Genoa, Venice etc) or as a group (imperial and free town of the holy roman empire). Whereas forms of autonomous governance also continued both in France (local mayors) and England (see entry for anglo-saxon England), monarchical presence seems to have been stronger here than in italy and germany.

Pharaoh relied heavily on his advisors when making decisions. As such, Royal Court had high enough authority to impose corporal punishments. Vizier, acting as Pharaoh's deputy, oversaw the administration of the Royal Court and partook in the decision-making process. Royal Court itself was heavily bureaucratic just like Egypt in general and was divided into various departments such as treasury, police, district, and each department had its main overseer who had to answer to Vizier. To ensure Vizier's informedness there was an institution of 'Hearers' who acted as the system of bureaucratic control. 

There were also local Pharaoh's administrations around Egypt run by the Herald, who informed Pharaoh of people's aspirations and acted as pharaoh's mouthpiece.

For local decision-making and legal proceedings there were two councils - Djadjat and Qenbet. Djadjat was the dominant council in the Old and Middle Kingdoms, and Qenbet was dominant in the New Kingdom. However, they both did exist during all three kingdoms just with varying levels of importance. From the readings, I got the impression that Qenbet was more concerned with local justice and Djadjat with local governance. They were run by local notables such as Mayors and Priests.


A story about the 'Eloquent Peasant' that shows the Egyptian Institution of Petitioning:

----- BACKSTORY OF ROBBERY -----
p. 1
“There was a man called Khunanup. He was a peasant of the Wadi Natrun and he had a wife called Meret”
“This peasant said to his wife of his: ‘Look, I am going to Egypt to fetch provisions there for my children’”
p. 3
“[???]”
p. 5
“He [peasant] came across a man”
“His name was Nemtinakht and he was the son of a man called Isry”
“These were liegemen of the high steward Rensi, son of Meru”
“And the Nemitinakht said, when he saw the donkeys of this peasant, which were desirable to his heart:”
p. 6
“‘Would that I had some divine image with which I could rob the good of this peasant!”
“Now, the house of the Nemtinakht was at a waterside path that was narrow, it was not broad: it measured the width of a loincloth. Its one side was under water, the other=er under barley.”
“This Nemtinankht then said to a servant of his:”
p. 7
“’Hurry, and bring me a cape from my house!’”
“Then he spread it out on the waterside path, so that its hem came to rest on water, and its selvage on the barley.”
“And this peasant came on the public path”
“This Nemtinakht then said: ‘Beware, peasant, you will not step on my clothes!”
p. 8
“And the peasant said: ‘I shall do what you wish; my way is good.’”
“And he went up higher. Then this Nemtinakht said: ‘Is my Upper-Egyptian barley to be a path for you?’”
“And this peasant said: ‘My ways are good; the bank is steep, and the ways are under barley for you block our path with your clothes!’”
p. 9
“’Will you then not allow us to pass on the path?’”
“As he had finished saying […] words, then one of the donkeys filled its mouth with a wisp of barley.”
“And this Nemtinakht said: ‘But look, your donkey is eating my barley!”
p. 10
… “I will buy my donkey for 10 times the value”
“Now, I know the lord of this district; it belongs to the high steward Rensi, son of Meru. He is the one who restrains every thief in this entire land.”
“Shall I now be robbed in his district?”
p. 11
…
“Then, he [Nemtinakht] took a rod of fresh tamarisk to him, and he thrashed all his [peasant’s] limbs with it, took his donkey away and drove them to his district”

----- STORY OF PETITIONING -----
p. 13
“Then this peasant spent a period of 10 days pleading with this Nemtinakht, but he did not pay attention to it.”
“This peasant then went to Herakleopolis in order to plead with the high steward Rensi, son of Meru”
p. 14
“He [peasant] found him [high steward Rensi] emerging from the door of his house, to step into his official boat.”
“And this peasant said: ‘May I be allowed to inform you about this grievance. Perhaps one may have a servant of your choice come to me, so that I may have him report to you about it.’”
p. 15-16
“And the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, had a servant of his choice go to him, and this peasant had him report back about this entire matter.”
“Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, accused the Nemitinakht to the officials who were with him.”
“But then they said to him: ‘Perhaps it is a peasant of his who went to someone else behind him. Look, that is what they do to peasants of theirs who have gone to others beside them. That is what they do. Is this a cause for punishing this Nemtinakht, on account of I little natron and a little salt? If he is ordered to replace it, then he will replace it.’”
p. 16
“But the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, remained silent.”
p. 17
“He did not answer these officials, nor did he answer this peasant.”
“Then this peasant came to pleas with him”
p. 21
“The high steward Rensi, son of Meru, then went before His Majesty and said: ‘My lord, I have found one of these peasants who is truly eloquent. By a man who is my peer. His goods have been robbed. He has come to please with me about it.’”
p. 22-23
“And His Majesty said: ‘As you wish to see me in health, you will delay him here without answering anything he says. So that he keeps speaking, remain silent. So that his speech will be brought to us in writing. So that we may hear it. But provide sustenance for the wife and children of this peasant. That one of these peasants comes here is because his house is empty. […] Furthermore, provide sustenance for this peasant himself. You will let the provisions be given to him without letting him know.’”
p. 24
“They were given to friends of his and his friends gave them to him.”
“Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, sent a message to the mayor of the Wadi Natrun about making provisions for the wife of this peasant.”
p. 36
“And the peasant came to plead with him for a third time”
P. 44
“When this peasant had said these words, the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, went to the entrance of the portal…”
p. 45
“…and made two guards turn against him with whips, and they thrashed all his limbs therewith”
p. 54
“You were appointed to hear cases, to judge between litigants and to punish the robber”
“But look, what you are doing is supporting the thief”
p. 59
“…and your environment is corrupt. And every man in your environment is corrupt”
p. 60
“High steward, my lord, you are the helm of the entire land, the land sails in accordance with your command. You are the equal of Thoth, who judges without being partial.”
p. 64
“Yet officials should be people who dispel injustice, lords of goodness, craftsmen in creating what is, people who men a severed head.”
p. 71
“And this peasant came to plead with him for a ninth time”
p. 76
“Look, I am pleading with you but you do not hear it.”
“I will go and plead concerning you with Anubis.”
“Then, the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, sent two guards to bring him back”
…
p. 77
“Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, said: ‘Don’t be afraid, peasant! Look, you will arrange the matter with me’” …
p. 78
“The high steward Rensi, son of Meru, said: ‘Now wait here and hear your petitions!’ And from a new papyrus roll he had every petition read out according to [its] content”
“Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, delivered them to the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Nebkaure, justified and they pleased his heart more than anything in his entire land.”
p. 79
“Then His Majesty said: ‘Pass judgement yourself, son of Meru!’
“And the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, sent two guards to [fetch Nemtinakht] Then he was brought and inventory was made of”
p. 80
“this Nemitankht […] to this peasant […] […] […] all his”

- In Egyptian wisdom literature addressing the subject of kingship: the so-called Teaching for King Merikare (c. 1900BCE). The narrator, himself apparently a king, gives the following advice to a future ruler: 
- ""Ensure that you are followed on account of your good character. Contemptible is he who forcefully binds the land to himself."" (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- This highlighting of the need to govern on the basis of popular support rather than brute force is then further elaborated on with specific reference to a conciliar form of government :
- ""Great is the great man whose great men are great, strong is the king who has councillors, wealthy is he who is rich in his nobles."" (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Moreover, in order to extract the most from his relationship with these influential subordinates, Pharaoh is advised to:
- ""Be skilled in speech, hence being strong, for the power of a king is his tongue. Speech is mightier than any combat."" (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- In these lines, the text expresses a fundamental truth about the nature of pharaonic government: while Pharaoh held office by divine right, the authority vested in the office was at its most effective only when Pharaoh ruled by consent, taking appropriate counsel and using powers of verbal persuasion to justify executive action. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- This chapter will consider the ways in which political discussions of this sort could take place, first by explicitly addressing the relationship between Pharaoh and his entourage, and subsequently moving on to explore other types of assemblies with capacity for decision-making. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
 - ... such texts, while varied in the events they describe, all conform to a fairly rigid overarching structure: Pharaoh announces a major undertaking, he discusses it with his courtiers, and the decision stemming therefrom then leads to Pharaoh’s triumph and the glory of Egypt. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- In a similar vein, a military inscription of Ramesses II also reveals a process of collective decision-making (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Thus, as a result of consultation with his subjects, Pharaoh could make decisions with important military and diplomatic consequences. (Alex Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- However, discussion was by no means limited to military matters and foreign affairs. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- For instance, the Prophecy of Neferti (c. 2000BCE), a narrative about a wise Pharaoh who invites a sage to tell him the future of the realm, starts with a description of routine business at the royal court. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- The impression given here is that Pharaoh held daily audiences with his assembled courtiers, and that the aim of this extended beyond simply being a ceremonial affirmation of royal power. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- In this example, Pharaoh is struck by an idea after the initial audience, and so calls the courtiers back for advice – which serves as the narrative device leading to the sage being invited. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- In another example, now known as the Building Inscription of Senusret I (c. 1950BCE), Pharaoh consults his courtiers before ordering a major construction project. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Likewise, discussion with courtiers seems to have also been required when Pharaoh was dealing with family matters – perhaps because of the potential implications this might have for the royal succession. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Thus, again the Pharaoh is shown to be conducting affairs of state with the assent of those around him. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Part of the story [Tale of Sinuhe (c. 2000BCE)] involves an Egyptian living abroad discussing the mechanisms by which Pharaoh rules Egypt, it being said that :
- ""He is the lord of graciousness, great of sweetness – he conquers by love. His city loves him more than its own self, and they rejoice for him more than for (any) god of theirs. The husbands and wives delight in him.""  (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Overall, the examples above therefore reveal that inclusive governance was present even at the very apex of political power in Ancient Egypt, it often being ingrained into the decision-making process of Pharaoh himself. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Given the limited nature of the evidence, it remains difficult to determine whether such consultation actually carried decisive political weight or served predominantly as a symbolic act of popular affirmation of predetermined royal policy. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Nonetheless, its very presence is highly significant, pointing to a clear need for Pharaoh to consult his people to generate legitimacy. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)","Consulted with the Courtiers of the Royal Court

The scala of viziral tasks and duties can be reduced to three basic aspects. They may be labelled resp.: (van den Boorn, p. 310)
1.	the vizier as managing director of the pr-nsw (royal palace)
2.	the vizier as head of the civil administration 
3.	the Vizier as the king's deputy

1. The Vizier as managing director of the Royal Palace (van den Boorn, p. 311)
- There can be no doubt that in theory the pr-nsw was ruled by the king personally. (van den Boorn, p. 311)
- On the other hand, section 3 has made it clear that its management and operation were delegated to the vizier. (van den Boorn, p. 311)
- He acted as its managing director in co-operation with the overseer of the treasury as his co-director. (van den Boorn, p. 311)
   1.1 Internal Operation
	the vizier receives daily reports by the responsible officials on the opening and closing of the btmw, ""enclosures"", denoting all housings in the complex (sections 2 and 3). (van den Boorn, p. 311)
	the vizier receives reports on all traffic entering the pr-nsw (section 2). (van den Boorn, p. 311)
	the vizier opens the Gold House (royal workshops and storehouses at the palace) together with the overseer of the treasury (R30, cf. analysis in section 3). (van den Boorn, p. 311)
	daily exchange of information between the vizier and the overseer of the treasury on their own affairs and on particular points of their own work that are of interest to the other (section 3). (van den Boorn, p. 311)
   1.2 Security, Internal Order and Justice
	the vizier receives reports on the condition of the northern and southern mnnww, ""guard-posts"" (section 2). (van den Boorn, p. 312)

	the vizier appoints the imy-r sntw to the h3 n pr-nsw, ""(reception-)hall of the pr-nsw"" (section 17). (van den Boorn, p. 312)
	in the event of improper behavior at a viziral session in the vizier's office, officials of his own bureau are arrested by the vizier's messengers (section 1). (van den Boorn, p. 312)
	the vizier questions any member of pr-nsw personnel that has to be interrogated (section 19) (van den Boorn, p. 312)
   1.3 Personnel
	the Vizier appoints the overseer of police(men) in the reception-hall of the pr-nsw (section 17). (van den Boorn, p. 313)

	the vizier gives daily orders to his messenger to have the gateways opened (by means of a writ), in order to allow the flow of traffic (section 3). (van den Boorn, p. 313)
	as head of the 'ryt the vizier uses the premises as a central place of punishment of officials (sections 4 and 19) and for receiving local officials (section 5). (van den Boorn, p. 313)
	The vizier dispatches every messenger of the pr-nsw carrying messages to local officials (section 12). (van den Boorn, p. 313)
	the vizier dispatches every official of the pr-nsw carrying written messages for circulation throughout Egypt (section 12). (van den Boorn, p. 313) 
	on the occasion of a journey of the king (and his staff, together the pr-nsw), the vizier organizes the military escort as well as the home forces which will stay behind as garrisons in the residential centres (not in the pr-nsw; section 14). (van den Boorn, p. 313)
	the vizier takes care of the supply of wood to the complex (the king, his court and institutional depencies; section 16). (van den Boorn, p. 313)
   1.5 pr-nsw as part of the hnw, 'residence-city'
	through a messenger the vizier controls the flow of traffic into the hnw (section 2). (van den Boorn, p. 314)

2. The Vizier as Head of the Civil Administration
The basic concept underlying the vizier's control over the civil administration appears to entail three interdependent notions,  
1.	viz. justice,  
2.	operational control 
3.	appointment of civil servants. (van den Boorn, p. 315)
   2.1 Justice
-	The juridical tasks of the Vizier with regard to the civil administration can be divided into those pertaining to civil servants in a personal capacity and those dealing with civil servants in their official capacity. (van den Boorn, p. 315)
-	Civil servants are the sole concern of the vizier when they commit, crimes, abuses or simple mistakes outside their strictly official capacity (at least without direct reference to their official capacity.) (van den Boorn, p. 315)
-	Civil servants committing crimes, abuses or culpable acts in their official capacity are dealt with initially in section 6. When doubts arise concerning. someone's performance of his official duty,·· the vizier hears him and gives him the opportunity to exculpate himself. (van den Boorn, p. 316)
- If he is unable to do so, the man and his deeds are entered on the criminal register in the ""great prison"". (van den Boorn, p. 316)
In other words, an official has a record of his official derelictions kept. (van den Boorn, p. 316)
- Should derelictions recur, this record of past conduct forms part of the juridical assessment of the new offence. (van den Boorn, p. 316)
- The record plus a verbal report on the former offence(s) are to be handed over to the vizier. (van den Boorn, p. 316)
   2.2 Operational Control
-	The text makes a distinction between the vizier's operational control over departments (h3w) and over civil servants as functionaries. (van den Boorn, p. 317)
-	Thus, we are facing a distinction between an amorphous group of departments on a central level (in the residence-city) and clearly defined officials/echelons on a local level of administration. (van den Boorn, p. 317)
                          Control over Departments (Central Level):
-	In the vizier's operational control over departments a crucial role is played by the hnrt wr, ""the great prison"" and its sdmw ""hearers"",(section 7).  (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	Detailed procedures regulate the processing of information on the departments. (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	They ensure that the vizier is informed of and has ultimate control over ongoing business. (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	Data on departments are processed in the form of provisional documents drawn up by scribes of the hnrt wr. 
-	The documents are the result of inquiries carried out by hearers (sdmw of the hnrt wr). (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	These officials, with powers delegated by the vizier, operate a system of bureaucratic control over the work and activities of departments. (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-       The departments operate in a relatively independent fashion and are only checked by the vizier through a post factum control. (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	Thus, on the central level of administration, the heads of h3w-departments have a considerable freedom of action (except for the dispensation of Justice to departmental officials, which is the direct and sole concern of the vizier, cf. section 4). (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	As their ultimate superior,' the vizier does not run this level of government, he only controls it. (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	The vizier leaves the actual supervision of the central departments to a subdivision of his own apparatus, viz. the ""great prison"". (van den Boorn, p. 319)
-	""Great prison', as a functional extension of the vizier's administration it seems to run a overall ""surveillance system"" of the various departments of the central government. (van den Boorn, p. 319)
                           Control over Civil Servants (Local Level) 
-	Here no intermediary body is found. (van den Boorn, p. 319)
-	Local echelons are ordered to report personally to the vizier. (van den Boorn, p. 319)
-	All local magistracies are obliged to report every four months on their accomplishments (section 13). (van den Boorn, p. 319)
-	Councillors of the district report to him their affairs (section 9), and urban authorities report on the state of security (section 17). (van den Boorn, p. 319)
-	What is remarkable is that these reports generally seem to postdate the reported activities (sections 9, 13 and 17). (van den Boorn, p. 319)
-	Only two fields of interest are exempt from this rule, viz. the agricultural and hydraulic tasks of the urban authorities and the councillors of the district (section 16). (van den Boorn, p. 319)
-	Here the vizier takes a direct interest in dispatching the officials with the appropriate instructions. (van den Boorn, p. 319)
-	It is evidently an interest of basic importance to the central administration. (van den Boorn, p. 319)
-	In general it would seem that the local administration functioned with a certain degree of independence. (van den Boorn, p. 319)
-	As in the case of the central departments, the vizier keeps a sort of ""distant control"", not by using an intermediary body, but by procedures mitigating - as it were - an all too direct control over the system. (van den Boorn, p. 319)
-	With the means of communications available around 1500 B.C in a country of the size of Egypt, any attempt to regulate a system of local administration centrally and in the greatest detail would have rendered the system hopelessly inefficient, to say the least. (van den Boorn, p. 320)
   2.3 Appointment of Civil Servants
-	In section 13 the vizier is said to be in charge of the appointment of the nty m srwt in his own area of competence. (van den Boorn, p. 320)
-	As we have argued, the term is a collective designation of the leading members of the main magistracies in the local administration. (van den Boorn, p. 320)
-	The term covers the urban authorities, the overseers of fields and the councillors of the district. (van den Boorn, p. 320)
-	The only other civil servants the vizier is said to appoint are stationed in the pr-nsw, viz. 'ryt-personnel(section 19) and the overseer of police(men) (section 17; cf. chapter 3.2.1 above). (van den Boorn, p. 320)
-	Thus, we are confronted with the interesting phenomenon of the vizier appointing the leading local officials and (at least part of) the pr-nsw-personnel, while the text is silent on the appointment of personnel to central departments. (van den Boorn, p. 320)
-	An explanation offers itself when we accept that this particular task belongs to the supervision of the departments by the hnrt wr. (van den Boorn, p. 320)
-	The vizier delegates the task to an extension of his own bureaucratic apparatus, for which reason The Duties makes no mention of it. (van den Boorn, p. 320)
-	An alternative that may come closer to historical reality, is that this task was in fact delegated to the heads of the h3w concerned, and was supervised by the ""great prison"". (van den Boorn, p. 320)


3. The Vizier as the King’s Deputy  (van den Boorn, p. 320-322)
1.	Personal Assistant/Secretary to the king
   a.	Main channel of communication to the king (and vice versa)
   b.	Mediator between the king and petitioner 
2.	Executive Assistant with delegated powers, as the king’s proxy
   a.	Enforcer of hp, ‘law’ 
   b.	As the sole official having knowledge of all royal decrees, it is he who will have to take care of their enactment or at least of their promulgation 
   c.	In theory all land in Egypt belonged to the king. For the upkeep of the bureaucracy the Vizier receives the delegated right to issue and withdraw such plots. 
   d.	Mediator between Pharaoh and Egypt (close personal relationship between king and vizier)

Pharaoh relied heavily on his advisors when making decisions. As such, Royal Court had high enough authority to impose corporal punishments. Vizier, acting as Pharaoh's deputy, oversaw the administration of the Royal Court and partook in the decision-making process. Royal Court itself was heavily bureaucratic just like Egypt in general and was divided into various departments such as treasury, police, district, and each department had its main overseer who had to answer to Vizier. To ensure Vizier's informedness there was an institution of 'Hearers' who acted as the system of bureaucratic control. 

There were also local Pharaoh's administrations around Egypt run by the Herald, who informed Pharaoh of people's aspirations and acted as pharaoh's mouthpiece.

For local decision-making and legal proceedings there were two councils - Djadjat and Qenbet. Djadjat was the dominant council in the Old and Middle Kingdoms, and Qenbet was dominant in the New Kingdom. However, they both did exist during all three kingdoms just with varying levels of importance. From the readings, I got the impression that Qenbet was more concerned with local justice and Djadjat with local governance. They were run by local notables such as Mayors and Priests.

Royal Court itself was heavily bureaucratic just like Egypt in general and was divided into various departments such as treasury, police, district, and each department had its main overseer who had to answer to Vizier. To ensure Vizier's informedness there was an institution of 'Hearers' who acted as the system of bureaucratic control. 

There were also local Pharaoh's administrations around Egypt run by the Herald, who informed Pharaoh of people's aspirations and acted as pharaoh's mouthpiece.

For local decision-making and legal proceedings there were two councils - Djadjat and Qenbet. Djadjat was the dominant council in the Old and Middle Kingdoms, and Qenbet was dominant in the New Kingdom. However, they both did exist during all three kingdoms just with varying levels of importance. From the readings, I got the impression that Qenbet was more concerned with local justice and Djadjat with local governance. They were run by local notables such as Mayors and Priests.


A story about the 'Eloquent Peasant' that shows the Egyptian Institution of Petitioning:

----- BACKSTORY OF ROBBERY -----
p. 1
“There was a man called Khunanup. He was a peasant of the Wadi Natrun and he had a wife called Meret”
“This peasant said to his wife of his: ‘Look, I am going to Egypt to fetch provisions there for my children’”
p. 3
“[???]”
p. 5
“He [peasant] came across a man”
“His name was Nemtinakht and he was the son of a man called Isry”
“These were liegemen of the high steward Rensi, son of Meru”
“And the Nemitinakht said, when he saw the donkeys of this peasant, which were desirable to his heart:”
p. 6
“‘Would that I had some divine image with which I could rob the good of this peasant!”
“Now, the house of the Nemtinakht was at a waterside path that was narrow, it was not broad: it measured the width of a loincloth. Its one side was under water, the other=er under barley.”
“This Nemtinankht then said to a servant of his:”
p. 7
“’Hurry, and bring me a cape from my house!’”
“Then he spread it out on the waterside path, so that its hem came to rest on water, and its selvage on the barley.”
“And this peasant came on the public path”
“This Nemtinakht then said: ‘Beware, peasant, you will not step on my clothes!”
p. 8
“And the peasant said: ‘I shall do what you wish; my way is good.’”
“And he went up higher. Then this Nemtinakht said: ‘Is my Upper-Egyptian barley to be a path for you?’”
“And this peasant said: ‘My ways are good; the bank is steep, and the ways are under barley for you block our path with your clothes!’”
p. 9
“’Will you then not allow us to pass on the path?’”
“As he had finished saying […] words, then one of the donkeys filled its mouth with a wisp of barley.”
“And this Nemtinakht said: ‘But look, your donkey is eating my barley!”
p. 10
… “I will buy my donkey for 10 times the value”
“Now, I know the lord of this district; it belongs to the high steward Rensi, son of Meru. He is the one who restrains every thief in this entire land.”
“Shall I now be robbed in his district?”
p. 11
…
“Then, he [Nemtinakht] took a rod of fresh tamarisk to him, and he thrashed all his [peasant’s] limbs with it, took his donkey away and drove them to his district”

----- STORY OF PETITIONING -----
p. 13
“Then this peasant spent a period of 10 days pleading with this Nemtinakht, but he did not pay attention to it.”
“This peasant then went to Herakleopolis in order to plead with the high steward Rensi, son of Meru”
p. 14
“He [peasant] found him [high steward Rensi] emerging from the door of his house, to step into his official boat.”
“And this peasant said: ‘May I be allowed to inform you about this grievance. Perhaps one may have a servant of your choice come to me, so that I may have him report to you about it.’”
p. 15-16
“And the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, had a servant of his choice go to him, and this peasant had him report back about this entire matter.”
“Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, accused the Nemitinakht to the officials who were with him.”
“But then they said to him: ‘Perhaps it is a peasant of his who went to someone else behind him. Look, that is what they do to peasants of theirs who have gone to others beside them. That is what they do. Is this a cause for punishing this Nemtinakht, on account of I little natron and a little salt? If he is ordered to replace it, then he will replace it.’”
p. 16
“But the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, remained silent.”
p. 17
“He did not answer these officials, nor did he answer this peasant.”
“Then this peasant came to pleas with him”
p. 21
“The high steward Rensi, son of Meru, then went before His Majesty and said: ‘My lord, I have found one of these peasants who is truly eloquent. By a man who is my peer. His goods have been robbed. He has come to please with me about it.’”
p. 22-23
“And His Majesty said: ‘As you wish to see me in health, you will delay him here without answering anything he says. So that he keeps speaking, remain silent. So that his speech will be brought to us in writing. So that we may hear it. But provide sustenance for the wife and children of this peasant. That one of these peasants comes here is because his house is empty. […] Furthermore, provide sustenance for this peasant himself. You will let the provisions be given to him without letting him know.’”
p. 24
“They were given to friends of his and his friends gave them to him.”
“Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, sent a message to the mayor of the Wadi Natrun about making provisions for the wife of this peasant.”
p. 36
“And the peasant came to plead with him for a third time”
P. 44
“When this peasant had said these words, the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, went to the entrance of the portal…”
p. 45
“…and made two guards turn against him with whips, and they thrashed all his limbs therewith”
p. 54
“You were appointed to hear cases, to judge between litigants and to punish the robber”
“But look, what you are doing is supporting the thief”
p. 59
“…and your environment is corrupt. And every man in your environment is corrupt”
p. 60
“High steward, my lord, you are the helm of the entire land, the land sails in accordance with your command. You are the equal of Thoth, who judges without being partial.”
p. 64
“Yet officials should be people who dispel injustice, lords of goodness, craftsmen in creating what is, people who men a severed head.”
p. 71
“And this peasant came to plead with him for a ninth time”
p. 76
“Look, I am pleading with you but you do not hear it.”
“I will go and plead concerning you with Anubis.”
“Then, the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, sent two guards to bring him back”
…
p. 77
“Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, said: ‘Don’t be afraid, peasant! Look, you will arrange the matter with me’” …
p. 78
“The high steward Rensi, son of Meru, said: ‘Now wait here and hear your petitions!’ And from a new papyrus roll he had every petition read out according to [its] content”

(Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- The process can be broken down into the following steps :
1.	Initial appeal to the herald of Elephantine , asking him to consider the transfer of Senbet from combined public and private service (working jointly for the city of Elephantine and a private master) to full-time service to a different private master.
2.	Herald decrees that the permission of all parties involved is necessary for the transfer to go ahead, and that approval of the royal palace, represented by the vizier, must also be sought.
3.	Vizier responds, saying that approval is possible provided that all other parties are satisfied.
4.	At the herald’s office, consent is obtained from the representatives of the city of Elephantine, the outgoing private master, and the prospective private master. Senbet herself and the governor of Elephantine are also informed that proceedings have reached this stage.      
5.	Herald’s office sends confirmation to the vizier that all relevant parties have consented.
6.	Vizier grants approval, conditional on Senbet being notified and all employers giving oaths at the herald’s office.
7.	Senbet is informed and employers give the required oaths at the herald’s office.
8.	Document confirming the completion of the procedure is drawn up and passed to the local djadjat for final approval and archiving. Senbet can start service for her new master.

Royal Court itself was heavily bureaucratic just like Egypt in general and was divided into various departments such as treasury, police, district, and each department had its main overseer who had to answer to Vizier. To ensure Vizier's informedness there was an institution of 'Hearers' who acted as the system of bureaucratic control. 

There were also local Pharaoh's administrations around Egypt run by the Herald, who informed Pharaoh of people's aspirations and acted as pharaoh's mouthpiece.

For local decision-making and legal proceedings there were two councils - Djadjat and Qenbet. Djadjat was the dominant council in the Old and Middle Kingdoms, and Qenbet was dominant in the New Kingdom. However, they both did exist during all three kingdoms just with varying levels of importance. From the readings, I got the impression that Qenbet was more concerned with local justice and Djadjat with local governance. They were run by local notables such as Mayors and Priests.


A story about the 'Eloquent Peasant' that shows the Egyptian Institution of Petitioning:

----- BACKSTORY OF ROBBERY -----
p. 1
“There was a man called Khunanup. He was a peasant of the Wadi Natrun and he had a wife called Meret”
“This peasant said to his wife of his: ‘Look, I am going to Egypt to fetch provisions there for my children’”
p. 3
“[???]”
p. 5
“He [peasant] came across a man”
“His name was Nemtinakht and he was the son of a man called Isry”
“These were liegemen of the high steward Rensi, son of Meru”
“And the Nemitinakht said, when he saw the donkeys of this peasant, which were desirable to his heart:”
p. 6
“‘Would that I had some divine image with which I could rob the good of this peasant!”
“Now, the house of the Nemtinakht was at a waterside path that was narrow, it was not broad: it measured the width of a loincloth. Its one side was under water, the other=er under barley.”
“This Nemtinankht then said to a servant of his:”
p. 7
“’Hurry, and bring me a cape from my house!’”
“Then he spread it out on the waterside path, so that its hem came to rest on water, and its selvage on the barley.”
“And this peasant came on the public path”
“This Nemtinakht then said: ‘Beware, peasant, you will not step on my clothes!”
p. 8
“And the peasant said: ‘I shall do what you wish; my way is good.’”
“And he went up higher. Then this Nemtinakht said: ‘Is my Upper-Egyptian barley to be a path for you?’”
“And this peasant said: ‘My ways are good; the bank is steep, and the ways are under barley for you block our path with your clothes!’”
p. 9
“’Will you then not allow us to pass on the path?’”
“As he had finished saying […] words, then one of the donkeys filled its mouth with a wisp of barley.”
“And this Nemtinakht said: ‘But look, your donkey is eating my barley!”
p. 10
… “I will buy my donkey for 10 times the value”
“Now, I know the lord of this district; it belongs to the high steward Rensi, son of Meru. He is the one who restrains every thief in this entire land.”
“Shall I now be robbed in his district?”
p. 11
…
“Then, he [Nemtinakht] took a rod of fresh tamarisk to him, and he thrashed all his [peasant’s] limbs with it, took his donkey away and drove them to his district”

----- STORY OF PETITIONING -----
p. 13
“Then this peasant spent a period of 10 days pleading with this Nemtinakht, but he did not pay attention to it.”
“This peasant then went to Herakleopolis in order to plead with the high steward Rensi, son of Meru”
p. 14
“He [peasant] found him [high steward Rensi] emerging from the door of his house, to step into his official boat.”
“And this peasant said: ‘May I be allowed to inform you about this grievance. Perhaps one may have a servant of your choice come to me, so that I may have him report to you about it.’”
p. 15-16
“And the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, had a servant of his choice go to him, and this peasant had him report back about this entire matter.”
“Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, accused the Nemitinakht to the officials who were with him.”
“But then they said to him: ‘Perhaps it is a peasant of his who went to someone else behind him. Look, that is what they do to peasants of theirs who have gone to others beside them. That is what they do. Is this a cause for punishing this Nemtinakht, on account of I little natron and a little salt? If he is ordered to replace it, then he will replace it.’”
p. 16
“But the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, remained silent.”
p. 17
“He did not answer these officials, nor did he answer this peasant.”
“Then this peasant came to pleas with him”
p. 21
“The high steward Rensi, son of Meru, then went before His Majesty and said: ‘My lord, I have found one of these peasants who is truly eloquent. By a man who is my peer. His goods have been robbed. He has come to please with me about it.’”
p. 22-23
“And His Majesty said: ‘As you wish to see me in health, you will delay him here without answering anything he says. So that he keeps speaking, remain silent. So that his speech will be brought to us in writing. So that we may hear it. But provide sustenance for the wife and children of this peasant. That one of these peasants comes here is because his house is empty. […] Furthermore, provide sustenance for this peasant himself. You will let the provisions be given to him without letting him know.’”

Eventually replaces the Djadjat in the new kingdom, at least in terms of nomenclature.

Most evidence comes from Deir-Al-Medina, which is a somewhat special place (skilled artisans working on royal tombs, very high literacy rate).

Members are local scribes (but less glorious than the scribes in the Djadjat), chiefs of workmen, and workmen. Selected based on age, literacy, and some form of decision structure among the workers yielding a 'representative'.

First evidence of ""industrial action,"" probably collective decision through the Qenbet, followed by negotiation with nomarch for several years (for more info, check out the Turin strike papyrus).



RA notes:
A Local Council run by local notables, priests and a local mayor that became the dominant form of local council under the New Kingdom despite existing previously as well. It, however, did not have as much authority as the Royal Court just like Djadjat so it was not able to impose corporal punishment such as mutilation. 

- Moving into the New Kingdom, a new council gained prominence: the qenbet, or ‘men of the angle’. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- This body had began life far earlier, with the first attestation dating back to a text of c. 2100BCE, the term originally referring to an obscure body of notables on whom a local potentate could call when he needed advice. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Until the onset of the New Kingdom, mentions of this term are few and far between, with djadjat being the standard term for a local council capable of making decisions. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- However, by the New Kingdom, the qenbet had become the dominant form of council and rules were laid down determining who was entitled to sit on it. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- The Pharaoh Horemheb (c. 1300BCE) issued a decree with the following provision :
- ""It is the high priests of the shrines, the mayors of the interior of this land , and the priests of the gods who are to make up any qenbet."" (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- The definition is nevertheless vague: no indication is given as to the number of people expected to sit on a qenbet, nor is it obvious whether the stipulations refer to absolutely any qenbet in Egypt, or merely any qenbet qualified to discuss and assess the provisions of the Horemheb decree. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- The latter ultimately appears more likely, as there is extensive evidence of individuals not belonging to any of the stated categories having membership of a qenbet – albeit a qenbet at village level, which was probably not senior enough to warrant the attention of Horemheb in his royal decree. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)


--- Qenbet in action through the Tomb Robbery Papyri---

Pesiur = the mayor of the city of Thebes 
☼	alleged the violation of the tomb of Amenophis I 
☼	accused the coppersmith Peikhal and his two fellow workers of making thefts in the Place of Beauty i. e. in the valley now known as the Tombs of the Queens 
☼	accused Amenpnufer in violation of the pyramid of Sebkemsaf 
☼	(it may well be, indeed, that all the royal tombs subsequently examined by the commission were specified in the charges laid by Pesiur before the vizier 

Reason…
-	Perhaps he felt that his official position was jeopardized by the open scandal of the tomb-robberies going on so near the seat of his authority. 
-	Conceivably also he was actuated by personal hostility to Pwerco, who was mayor of the west of Thebes where the necropolis lay. 
-	Or else, lastly, genuine indignation at the outrages and loyalty towards the absent Pharaoh may have been his inspiration

Great Tribunal/’the Great Notables’ members
-	Mayor --- Pesiur (the mayor was ex officio a member)
-	Vizier --- Vizier Khaemwese represented justice in the abstract
-	Royal Butlers --- Royal butlers Nasamun and Nefereremperamun may have owed their places on the courtto their close connection with the king
-	High Priest --- At the sessions on the 21st and 22nd, Amenhotpe, the high priest of Amun, was another prominent member yielding precedence only to the vizier
-	Representatives of the army and the navy --- Representatives of the army and the navy were, together with 
-	Second Priest of Amun --- the second priest of Amun, the remaining officialsconstituting the body usually referred to as ‘the Great Notables’.

1 step taken by the magistrates: send out a commission to visit all the tombs suspected of having been robbed.

Comission = termed the ‘controllers (rwdw) of the great and noble necropolis’ 
-	Consisted of Pwerco (the other mayor), 
-	his subordinate police officers, 
-	some priests of the temple of Medinet Habu,
-	private secretaries of Nesamun and Neferkeremperamun respectively 

p. 187-188
investigation and results

p. 189
Unhappy with Great Tribunal, Pesiur (mayor) cast a reflection on the fairness of the Great Tribunal by swearing that he would appeal to Pharaoh over its head.

p. 190
The mayor Pesiur, though himself a member of the court, was found in the wrong.
…
At the end of the trial he and several others were surrendered to the high-priest until instructions should come from Pharaoh as to their punishment.
This seems to have been by virtue of old and humane law according to which Pharaoh alone had the right to authorise a criminal’s death or mutilation.

Exists already in the old kingdom.

A Local Council, headed by the nomarch. Members hold priestly or scribal titles. Patronage by the nomarch is probably the main, but not the only, means of access. Aids the nomarch in tax collection, administration, policing.

Gathers probably with regular frequency, but we don't know how frequently. no direct evidence about decision-making, but by ethnographic parallels, it probably included extensive deliberations aimed at unanimity


RA notes:
Probably without any royal oversight, run by Local Notables and concerned with local government, administration and legal proceedings. In the religious sense, it was also a venue for judging the deceased. Djadjat, however, did not have as much authority as the the Royal Court, so it was not able to impose corporal punishment such as mutilation. Djadjat was the dominant council capable of making decisions under the Old and Middle Kingdom. By the time of the New Kingdom, Qenbet became more significant. 

- The oldest Egyptian term for a council – or at least some sort of gathering of notables – is the djadjat (‘the men of the circle’); a term which in origin most likely denoted the circle of people who came together to discuss the affairs of their local community, probably without any royal oversight. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- In the case on an Old Kingdom stela concerned with the sale of a house in Giza (c. 2300BCE), it appears that djadjat played a judicial role in validating property transactions. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- The presence of the buyer, seller, and witnesses before the djadjat suggests a modus operandi resembling a court of law, although the procedure here is merely of legal affirmation rather than the settlement of any dispute. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- One tablet (c. 2200BCE) reveals that the djadjat was responsible for managing logistical matters, such as booking the arrival of potters for local officials. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Others, written in a similar style, allude to the djadjat being involved in the organisation of agriculture, tax collection and procurement of labour for construction projects. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Indeed, the presence of a djadjat seems to have been a marker of a viable, well-run community, so much so that Old Kingdom religious texts already refer to the supernatural community of the gods having its own djadjat.  (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Thus, leading figures in the state administration, such as the sole companion of the king Tjay (c. 2450BCE), the vizier Kagemni (c. 2300BCE) and the royal overseer of works Ity (c. 2300BCE), allude to how they expect the divine djadjat to intercede on their behalf against anyone who might wish to violate their tombs. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- In the Middle Kingdom, the djadjat continued in a very similar role.  (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- The most detailed example of its activity is recorded in Papyrus Berlin 10470 (c. 1650BCE), which describes in remarkable detail how the local djadjat of the city of Elephantine considered what seems a fairly low-level request to alter the working arrangements of a single female servant named Senbet.  (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- The process can be broken down into the following steps :
1.	Initial appeal to the herald of Elephantine , asking him to consider the transfer of Senbet from combined public and private service (working jointly for the city of Elephantine and a private master) to full-time service to a different private master.
2.	Herald decrees that the permission of all parties involved is necessary for the transfer to go ahead, and that approval of the royal palace, represented by the vizier, must also be sought.
3.	Vizier responds, saying that approval is possible provided that all other parties are satisfied.
4.	At the herald’s office, consent is obtained from the representatives of the city of Elephantine, the outgoing private master, and the prospective private master. Senbet herself and the governor of Elephantine are also informed that proceedings have reached this stage.      
5.	Herald’s office sends confirmation to the vizier that all relevant parties have consented.
6.	Vizier grants approval, conditional on Senbet being notified and all employers giving oaths at the herald’s office.
7.	Senbet is informed and employers give the required oaths at the herald’s office.
8.	Document confirming the completion of the procedure is drawn up and passed to the local djadjat for final approval and archiving. Senbet can start service for her new master. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- This procedure, while undoubtedly bureaucratic and cumbersome, indicates a high level of inclusivity in local governance – the state was not simply prepared to re-assign a servant from one domain to another, but deemed it necessary to consult all parties with a view to achieving the satisfaction of each. (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- There is ample evidence for the Middle Kingdom djadjat having an extensive record-keeping staff, with the title ‘scribe of the djadjat’ becoming common and many holders of this title possessing their own seals .  (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- The presence of a dedicated bureaucracy is consistent would be consistent with the institution regularly needing to handle complex tasks of the sort outlined above.  (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- Much like in the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom djadjat also continued to be involved in various other spheres of activity connected to local government and administration, such as building boats , supplying grain , managing convict labourers  and maintaining good order in the temples .  (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)
- It is highly significant that all these diverse activities were therefore run by a council, indicative of some degree of inclusive governance, and not by a single appointed official as one might expect in a top-down, strictly hierarchical political system.  (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt)


Old Kingdom:
-	These texts clearly indicate that the djadjat could be a venue for quite complex legal proceedings, involving oaths, witnesses, messengers, and transfer of property. (Alex Loktionov, PhD, p. 82)
-	In the religious literature of the period, it is also a venue for judging the deceased (Goedicke 1963: 340) 66. (Alex Loktionov, PhD, p.82)
-	However, it is striking that it is attested so rarely in title strings, and that the attestations which do exist invariably have close ties to scribal bureaucracy. (Alex Loktionov, PhD, p. 83)
-	One possibility might be that the djadjat, designating a group of people rather than any specific location, was in fact a far more common and informal outlet for daily justice than its more elite and hence better documented counterparts like the wsh.t or hw.t-wr.t 67. (Alex Loktionov, PhD, p. 83)
-	It may have operated at a lower level along oral-aural lines, adjudicating between people who did not regularly produce texts, convening outside the temple setting or the realm of royal administration, and only appearing in the written record on the rare occasions when scribal involvement did prove necessary.  (Alex Loktionov, PhD, p. 83)
-	If so, it may have resembled the customary village assemblies prevalent in traditional societies in sub-Saharan Africa, as discussed in the ethnographic overview in the previous chapter68. (Alex Loktionov, PhD, p. 83)

Middle Kingdom:
-	Overall, it therefore seems highly likely that in the Middle Kingdom the djadjat was an administrative body with a wide remit, with justice being one component among many. (Alex Loktionov, PhD, p. 113)
-	By this time it might in certain cases have developed a more rigid structure with a permanent or semi-permanent staff, and could be associated with high officials. (Alex PhD, p. 113)
-	However, the presence of regional, less formal djadjat-courts naturally cannot be excluded and indeed seems highly probable. (Alex Loktionov, PhD, p. 113)
-	It is noteworthy that, despite its relative prominence, there is not a single attestation of the djadjat in the title strings of Middle Kingdom officials involved in sdm – this may suggest that its participation in justice was still largely based on informal methods.

Pharaoh relied heavily on his advisors when making decisions. As such, Royal Court had high enough authority to impose corporal punishments. Vizier, acting as Pharaoh's deputy, oversaw the administration of the Royal Court and partook in the decision-making process. Royal Court itself was heavily bureaucratic just like Egypt in general and was divided into various departments such as treasury, police, district, and each department had its main overseer who had to answer to Vizier. To ensure Vizier's informedness there was an institution of 'Hearers' who acted as the system of bureaucratic control. 

There were also local Pharaoh's administrations around Egypt run by the Herald, who informed Pharaoh of people's aspirations and acted as pharaoh's mouthpiece.

For local decision-making and legal proceedings there were two councils - Djadjat and Qenbet. Djadjat was the dominant council in the Old and Middle Kingdoms, and Qenbet was dominant in the New Kingdom. However, they both did exist during all three kingdoms just with varying levels of importance. From the readings, I got the impression that Qenbet was more concerned with local justice and Djadjat with local governance. They were run by local notables such as Mayors and Priests.


A story about the 'Eloquent Peasant' that shows the Egyptian Institution of Petitioning:

----- BACKSTORY OF ROBBERY -----
p. 1
“There was a man called Khunanup. He was a peasant of the Wadi Natrun and he had a wife called Meret”
“This peasant said to his wife of his: ‘Look, I am going to Egypt to fetch provisions there for my children’”
p. 3
“[???]”
p. 5
“He [peasant] came across a man”
“His name was Nemtinakht and he was the son of a man called Isry”
“These were liegemen of the high steward Rensi, son of Meru”
“And the Nemitinakht said, when he saw the donkeys of this peasant, which were desirable to his heart:”
p. 6
“‘Would that I had some divine image with which I could rob the good of this peasant!”
“Now, the house of the Nemtinakht was at a waterside path that was narrow, it was not broad: it measured the width of a loincloth. Its one side was under water, the other=er under barley.”
“This Nemtinankht then said to a servant of his:”
p. 7
“’Hurry, and bring me a cape from my house!’”
“Then he spread it out on the waterside path, so that its hem came to rest on water, and its selvage on the barley.”
“And this peasant came on the public path”
“This Nemtinakht then said: ‘Beware, peasant, you will not step on my clothes!”
p. 8
“And the peasant said: ‘I shall do what you wish; my way is good.’”
“And he went up higher. Then this Nemtinakht said: ‘Is my Upper-Egyptian barley to be a path for you?’”
“And this peasant said: ‘My ways are good; the bank is steep, and the ways are under barley for you block our path with your clothes!’”
p. 9
“’Will you then not allow us to pass on the path?’”
“As he had finished saying […] words, then one of the donkeys filled its mouth with a wisp of barley.”
“And this Nemtinakht said: ‘But look, your donkey is eating my barley!”
p. 10
… “I will buy my donkey for 10 times the value”
“Now, I know the lord of this district; it belongs to the high steward Rensi, son of Meru. He is the one who restrains every thief in this entire land.”
“Shall I now be robbed in his district?”
p. 11

p. 14
“He [peasant] found him [high steward Rensi] emerging from the door of his house, to step into his official boat.”
“And this peasant said: ‘May I be allowed to inform you about this grievance. Perhaps one may have a servant of your choice come to me, so that I may have him report to you about it.’”
p. 15-16
“And the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, had a servant of his choice go to him, and this peasant had him report back about this entire matter.”
“Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, accused the Nemitinakht to the officials who were with him.”
“But then they said to him: ‘Perhaps it is a peasant of his who went to someone else behind him. Look, that is what they do to peasants of theirs who have gone to others beside them. That is what they do. Is this a cause for punishing this Nemtinakht, on account of I little natron and a little salt? If he is ordered to replace it, then he will replace it.’”

p. 22-23
“And His Majesty said: ‘As you wish to see me in health, you will delay him here without answering anything he says. So that he keeps speaking, remain silent. So that his speech will be brought to us in writing. So that we may hear it. But provide sustenance for the wife and children of this peasant. That one of these peasants comes here is because his house is empty. […] Furthermore, provide sustenance for this peasant himself. You will let the provisions be given to him without letting him know.’”

- ""It is the high priests of the shrines, the mayors of the interior of this land , and the priests of the gods who are to make up any qenbet"" (Alex Loktionov, Inclusive Governance in Ancient Egypt).

- The gods were served by priests, of different grades and functions. (Rice, xxxvi)
- In the early centuries all Egyptians of standing were expected to serve as priests in the temples, for an agreed period each year; this represented more of a social obligation than evidence of a religious vocation. (Rice, xxxvi)
- Later, as the perquisites of the temple hierarchies grew, the priesthood became increasingly professional. (Rice, xxxvi)
- Many of the most rewarding of the temple benefices became hereditary fiefs. (Rice, xxxvi)
- Nonetheless, the king was notionally the High Priest of every cult, the temple priests merely his surrogates. (Rice, xxxvi)
- However, each major temple community was directed by High Priest whose power was often very great. (Rice, xxxvi)
- Some of the High Priesthoods, such as that of Ptah of Memphis, Re of Heliopolis and Amun of Thebes  were the greatest political figures in the state; eventually, the power of some of them was to rival, if it did not exceed, the power of the kings. (Rice, xxxvi)

- This last category of scribe might well be a priest, serving the god in a particular capacity and occupying a place in the intensely hierarchic gradings of temple personnel. (Rice, lvi)
- These ranged from the High Priest, who presided over the entire concerns of the temple, which in some cases came in time to rival the power of the king himself; the Second, Third and Fourth Prophets, who were the senior clergy of the Temple; and to minor functionaries who, though their duties might be quite humble—cleaning the temple for example or ensuring that the god’s clothes or daily rations were in order— nonetheless valued highly their employment in the temple, which provided an absolute security for life.

Pharaoh relied heavily on his advisors when making decisions. As such, Royal Court had high enough authority to impose corporal punishments. Vizier, acting as Pharaoh's deputy, oversaw the administration of the Royal Court and partook in the decision-making process. Royal Court itself was heavily bureaucratic just like Egypt in general and was divided into various departments such as treasury, police, district, and each department had its main overseer who had to answer to Vizier. To ensure Vizier's informedness there was an institution of 'Hearers' who acted as the system of bureaucratic control. 

There were also local Pharaoh's administrations around Egypt run by the Herald, who informed Pharaoh of people's aspirations and acted as pharaoh's mouthpiece.

For local decision-making and legal proceedings there were two councils - Djadjat and Qenbet. Djadjat was the dominant council in the Old and Middle Kingdoms, and Qenbet was dominant in the New Kingdom. However, they both did exist during all three kingdoms just with varying levels of importance. From the readings, I got the impression that Qenbet was more concerned with local justice and Djadjat with local governance. They were run by local notables such as Mayors and Priests.


A story about the 'Eloquent Peasant' that shows the Egyptian Institution of Petitioning:

----- BACKSTORY OF ROBBERY -----
p. 1
“There was a man called Khunanup. He was a peasant of the Wadi Natrun and he had a wife called Meret”
“This peasant said to his wife of his: ‘Look, I am going to Egypt to fetch provisions there for my children’”
p. 3
“[???]”
p. 5
“He [peasant] came across a man”
“His name was Nemtinakht and he was the son of a man called Isry”
“These were liegemen of the high steward Rensi, son of Meru”
“And the Nemitinakht said, when he saw the donkeys of this peasant, which were desirable to his heart:”
p. 6
“‘Would that I had some divine image with which I could rob the good of this peasant!”
“Now, the house of the Nemtinakht was at a waterside path that was narrow, it was not broad: it measured the width of a loincloth. Its one side was under water, the other=er under barley.”
“This Nemtinankht then said to a servant of his:”
p. 7
“’Hurry, and bring me a cape from my house!’”
“Then he spread it out on the waterside path, so that its hem came to rest on water, and its selvage on the barley.”
“And this peasant came on the public path”
“This Nemtinakht then said: ‘Beware, peasant, you will not step on my clothes!”
p. 8
“And the peasant said: ‘I shall do what you wish; my way is good.’”
“And he went up higher. Then this Nemtinakht said: ‘Is my Upper-Egyptian barley to be a path for you?’”
“And this peasant said: ‘My ways are good; the bank is steep, and the ways are under barley for you block our path with your clothes!’”
p. 9
“’Will you then not allow us to pass on the path?’”
“As he had finished saying […] words, then one of the donkeys filled its mouth with a wisp of barley.”
“And this Nemtinakht said: ‘But look, your donkey is eating my barley!”
p. 10
… “I will buy my donkey for 10 times the value”
“Now, I know the lord of this district; it belongs to the high steward Rensi, son of Meru. He is the one who restrains every thief in this entire land.”
“Shall I now be robbed in his district?”
p. 11
…
“Then, he [Nemtinakht] took a rod of fresh tamarisk to him, and he thrashed all his [peasant’s] limbs with it, took his donkey away and drove them to his district”

----- STORY OF PETITIONING -----
p. 13
“Then this peasant spent a period of 10 days pleading with this Nemtinakht, but he did not pay attention to it.”
“This peasant then went to Herakleopolis in order to plead with the high steward Rensi, son of Meru”
p. 14
“He [peasant] found him [high steward Rensi] emerging from the door of his house, to step into his official boat.”
“And this peasant said: ‘May I be allowed to inform you about this grievance. Perhaps one may have a servant of your choice come to me, so that I may have him report to you about it.’”
p. 15-16
“And the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, had a servant of his choice go to him, and this peasant had him report back about this entire matter.”
“Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, accused the Nemitinakht to the officials who were with him.”
“But then they said to him: ‘Perhaps it is a peasant of his who went to someone else behind him. Look, that is what they do to peasants of theirs who have gone to others beside them. That is what they do. Is this a cause for punishing this Nemtinakht, on account of I little natron and a little salt? If he is ordered to replace it, then he will replace it.’”
p. 16
“But the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, remained silent.”
p. 17
“He did not answer these officials, nor did he answer this peasant.”
“Then this peasant came to pleas with him”
p. 21
“The high steward Rensi, son of Meru, then went before His Majesty and said: ‘My lord, I have found one of these peasants who is truly eloquent. By a man who is my peer. His goods have been robbed. He has come to please with me about it.’”
p. 22-23
“And His Majesty said: ‘As you wish to see me in health, you will delay him here without answering anything he says. So that he keeps speaking, remain silent. So that his speech will be brought to us in writing. So that we may hear it. But provide sustenance for the wife and children of this peasant. That one of these peasants comes here is because his house is empty. […] Furthermore, provide sustenance for this peasant himself. You will let the provisions be given to him without letting him know.’”
p. 24
“They were given to friends of his and his friends gave them to him.”
“Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, sent a message to the mayor of the Wadi Natrun about making provisions for the wife of this peasant.”
p. 36
“And the peasant came to plead with him for a third time”
P. 44
“When this peasant had said these words, the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, went to the entrance of the portal…”
p. 45
“…and made two guards turn against him with whips, and they thrashed all his limbs therewith”
p. 54
“You were appointed to hear cases, to judge between litigants and to punish the robber”
“But look, what you are doing is supporting the thief”
p. 59
“…and your environment is corrupt. And every man in your environment is corrupt”
p. 60
“High steward, my lord, you are the helm of the entire land, the land sails in accordance with your command. You are the equal of Thoth, who judges without being partial.”
p. 64
“Yet officials should be people who dispel injustice, lords of goodness, craftsmen in creating what is, people who men a severed head.”
p. 71
“And this peasant came to plead with him for a ninth time”
p. 76
“Look, I am pleading with you but you do not hear it.”
“I will go and plead concerning you with Anubis.”
“Then, the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, sent two guards to bring him back”
…
p. 77
“Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, said: ‘Don’t be afraid, peasant! Look, you will arrange the matter with me’” …
p. 78
“The high steward Rensi, son of Meru, said: ‘Now wait here and hear your petitions!’ And from a new papyrus roll he had every petition read out according to [its] content”
“Then the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, delivered them to the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Nebkaure, justified and they pleased his heart more than anything in his entire land.”
p. 79
“Then His Majesty said: ‘Pass judgement yourself, son of Meru!’
“And the high steward Rensi, son of Meru, sent two guards to [fetch Nemtinakht] Then he was brought and inventory was made of”
p. 80
“this Nemitankht […] to this peasant […] […] […] all his”

- The hnrt wr may be considered a functional extension of the vizier's administration, a central facility at his disposal. (van den Boorn, p. 316)
-	In the vizier's operational control over departments a crucial role is played by the hnrt wr, ""the great prison"" and its sdmw ""hearers"",(section 7).  (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	Detailed procedures regulate the processing of information on the departments. (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	They ensure that the vizier is informed of and has ultimate control over ongoing business. (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	Data on departments are processed in the form of provisional documents drawn up by scribes of the hnrt wr. 
-	The documents are the result of inquiries carried out by hearers (sdmw of the hnrt wr). (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	These officials, with powers delegated by the vizier, operate a system of bureaucratic control over the work and activities of departments. (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	Provisional documents are submitted to the vizier together with ‘Sammelberichten’ (sfdw) of the previous documentation on a particular department stored in the hnrt wr. (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	After inspection (and ensuing assessment) the document is sealed by the vizier and stored in the hnrt wr. (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	Thus, the vizier controls the departments in a rather impersonal manner, mainly through written documentation. (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	Two points are of particular interest. (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	The hearing or inquiry by the hearers and the ensuing inspection of the relevant documents by the vizier appear to postdate the actual activity of the department. (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	In other words, the departments operate in a relatively independent fashion and are only checked by the vizier through a post factum control. (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	The second point is, the typical role played by the ""great prison"". (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	As a functional extension of the vizier's administration it seems to run a overall ""surveillance system"" of the various departments of the central government. (van den Boorn, p. 318)
-	The vizier leaves the actual supervision of the central departments to a subdivision of his own apparatus, viz. the ""great prison"". (van den Boorn, p. 319)

Pharaoh relied heavily on his advisors when making decisions. As such, Royal Court had high enough authority to impose corporal punishments. Vizier, acting as Pharaoh's deputy, oversaw the administration of the Royal Court and partook in the decision-making process. Royal Court itself was heavily bureaucratic just like Egypt in general and was divided into various departments such as treasury, police, district, and each department had its main overseer who had to answer to Vizier. To ensure Vizier's informedness there was an institution of 'Hearers' who acted as the system of bureaucratic control. 

There were also local Pharaoh's administrations around Egypt run by the Herald, who informed Pharaoh of people's aspirations and acted as pharaoh's mouthpiece.

For local decision-making and legal proceedings there were two councils - Djadjat and Qenbet. Djadjat was the dominant council in the Old and Middle Kingdoms, and Qenbet was dominant in the New Kingdom. However, they both did exist during all three kingdoms just with varying levels of importance. From the readings, I got the impression that Qenbet was more concerned with local justice and Djadjat with local governance. They were run by local notables such as Mayors and Priests.

o	‘The Confederation made it possible for the Iroquois peoples to remain sovereign over their vast territories until the end of the eighteenth century.’ (305)
o	‘For all three of these peoples, the deep-seated cultural changes were not confined to ending the priestly-elite; they also led to a new form of government that fundamentally ended hierarchical, male-dominated, hereditary privileges. This was the basis on which the Iroquois created their brilliant Constitution and celebrated Confederation—which is excellent evidence of a great, matriarchally-based society oriented to the common good.’ (301)
o	‘Clans are female, but include males; nations are male, but include females. All matters must circulate in an ongoing process between these two polar powers.’
o	‘Traditionally, the local and federal were interdependent, equivalent entities, rather than having been hierarchically ordered the way they are in patriarchal dominance societies. The local represented the sacred will of the people, the “grassroots level” of Mother Earth herself, and was run by the clan mothers. In the local clan houses, all decisions were made by consensus among all clan members, and all clan houses were represented in the Women’s Clan Council, an elected body presided over by the Jigonsaseh.’ (305-06)
o	‘The federal side, presided over by the men, was made up not of clans, but of nations, as represented in the League of the Nations in the Men’s Grand Council. Although decisions and messages were communicated and handled here, they did not originate here. The men might only discuss an issue after the women had gone over it, which made the Women’s Clan Council the more powerful one— their deliberations effectively set the men’s agenda. Similarly, if the Men’s Grand Council did not dispose of an issue in the way that the Women’s Clan Council preferred, the women could take up the matter anew, reformulate it, and send it back to the men for reconsideration. This means the women’s council retained what amounted to a judicial review of men’s actions, and could stop them; the men’s council could not do the same to the women’s actions. However, this does not mean the Women’s Clan Council had too much power, because it included the consensus not just of the women in the council, but the consensus of the people—all the clan houses, including the women, men, and children who belonged to them.’ (306)
o	‘The Women’s Clan Council, as sole authority at the local level of government, is the first right of women explicitly granted in the Constitution. The second explicit right is that women are the exclusive guardians of war and peace; that is, they had the right to decide these matters. The concept behind this is that, in order to secure the future of society, women and children must have the absolute right to peace and security. To achieve this, Iroquoian women retained the weapons, relinquishing them only when the Women’s Clan Council had resolved to suspend women’s right to peace, having made this public through their spokespersons, the clan mothers or their male speakers. However, in their traditional way of life this happened only very rarely, for the clan mothers were not interested in sacrificing their children’ (306)
o	‘These two political rights of women may seem to imply that the Iroquois gave too much weight to female power, but in their law, an additional provision emphasized male power. This emphasis emerges in the distinction between “hereditary chiefs,” or clan peace chiefs, whose job was to protect the “Innocents,” resolve conflict, and manage inter-national negotiations, and “merit chiefs,” whose selection was based on their various services to the community. Hereditary chiefs were selected exclusively by women for specific council seats held by the clans, whereas merit chiefs were selected exclusively by men; their selection was based on their merit, although hereditarily seats did not exist. For men, in addition to showing mature judgement, one of the ways to earn merit was by acting as a war chief, a position chosen by men after women had given war a go-ahead.’ (306)
o	‘A feud took place after being decided upon in the war council. In this council, lines of relationship played no role since the merit chief, who sat in the war council, was not elected on the basis of clan structures. Thus, feuds were the formal reason for the resolutions of war council, but often this masked the young men’s thirst for adventure and ambitions for advancement. Feuds were carried out based on private initiative of volunteers, and whether or not a feud actually went forward depended completely on the war chief ’s popularity. He would dig up the hatchet (a red-painted tomahawk decorated with red feathers) and plunge it into the village war post. Then, fully adorned and emitting loud war cries, he would begin the war dance. By then, everyone in the village knew that a feud was planned, and those who voluntarily chose to follow the chief joined in the war dance. However, just as often, no one danced with him, and he went home in disgrace.’ (307-308)
o	‘The Iroquois could not undertake feuds without the explicit consent of women. Additionally, the young men who set off in a war party had to be supplied by the women with long-lasting provisions of cornmeal; otherwise, they could not carry out these forays. The women apportioned the food not only for the feuds, but also for the trade expeditions, so the final decisions about these things were in women’s hands. By withholding their political and economic assent, women in the village or town could stop a feud from taking place. And they did stop it, when the elder lineage chiefs thought it was a bad idea.’ (308)
o	‘The house-based council was not only for handling household matters; it was, at the same time, the vehicle for general policy. The chosen representatives of the Ohwachira participated in clan, town, and federal politics. Every Ohwachira had, in addition, the right to launch political initiatives and could convey the Ohwachira’s wishes and expectations to bodies at the nation level and federal level. In this way, households reflected the wishes and claims of all Iroquois—and even of children, as the voting rules weighted a woman’s vote according to the number of children she had. All political opinion and decision-making was based on household councils. Thus, the social and political order presented itself not as a top-down domination, but as a network based on consensus building from below.’ (310)
o	‘If an Ohwachira possessed a hereditary political office, the opportunities for influencing the greater community expanded considerably. The Sachems were chosen in councils made up of the clan mothers and adult women. The Royaneh had the last word, but, once consensus was achieved, she could not overrule it. Aptitude and experience were deciding factors. In this way, women selected the representatives who made up the political bodies in the town, the nation, and in the League. Therefore, these hereditary chiefs acted primarily in the interests of their own clans, particularly the women. Iroquoian women were present at men’s gatherings and heard everything that went on, and so had great political influence and responsibility.’ (310)
o	‘Sachems, or Peace Chiefs, were responsible for quickly resolving conflicts, whether at the town, national, or federal level, and they took the initiative to settle disputes. Nevertheless, by possessing this title, a man became the delegate of his Ohwachira, so that each Sachem was dependent upon the instructions of the Royaneh. In response to poor performance, or headstrong behavior, or infringement of the ideals or laws of the Confederation, she could unseat him. Custom dictated that an offending Sachem would be warned three times: first by the Royaneh acting alone; then by the clan’s male speaker, the Young Man; and finally by the Royaneh and the Young Man together. If all these did not produce results, the Royaneh would revoke the Sachem’s title and his emblems, giving them to another chosen clan representative. The entire clan would of course be paying attention to the Royaneh’s administrative leadership, and she too could be replaced after three warnings’ (310)
o	‘Also at the national councils, the two clan chiefs—Royaneh and Sachem—were present, but the management of this differed among different nations. The Attiwendaronk were a very special group, their national council seems to have had the maximum number of female members possible: four fifths of their council chiefs were women. The clan mothers were in just about total control among the Attiwendaronk. The Confederacy, however, modified that to a more parallel system of national councils as sphere of men, and clan councils as sphere of women. There were also female chiefs at the level of the Confederation; in fact, there were just as many women as men. This was verified by a white woman ethnologist, who herself was a Seneca female chief in the Iroquois Confederation (Harriet Converse).49 During the wars of conquest, the Gantowisas saw themselves as being obliged to assume, in national and federal councils, the roles of imprisoned and murdered Sachems. In these desperate situations the Seneca and Attiwendaronk Gantowisas even took up arms, fighting as soldiers alongside the men: in 1687 the League’s Jigonsaseh personally assumed military control, and handed the French a heavy defeat in 1689, near Montreal.’ (310-11)
o	‘all these kinship groups and political groups were traditionally responsible to the Councils of Elders; these bodies aggregated the experience and wisdom of age and took vigilant care to ensure that Sachems’ decisions were compatible with traditional social values. They were the guardians of the culture’s unwritten laws. However, the women’s councils spoke first and controlled the agenda of both the Grandmothers’ and Grandfathers’ councils’’ (311)

However, this does not mean the Women’s Clan Council had too much power, because it included the consensus not just of the women in the council, but the consensus of the people—all the clan houses, including the women, men, and children who belonged to them.’ (306)
o	‘The Women’s Clan Council, as sole authority at the local level of government, is the first right of women explicitly granted in the Constitution. The second explicit right is that women are the exclusive guardians of war and peace; that is, they had the right to decide these matters. The concept behind this is that, in order to secure the future of society, women and children must have the absolute right to peace and security. To achieve this, Iroquoian women retained the weapons, relinquishing them only when the Women’s Clan Council had resolved to suspend women’s right to peace, having made this public through their spokespersons, the clan mothers or their male speakers. However, in their traditional way of life this happened only very rarely, for the clan mothers were not interested in sacrificing their children’ (306)
o	‘These two political rights of women may seem to imply that the Iroquois gave too much weight to female power, but in their law, an additional provision emphasized male power. This emphasis emerges in the distinction between “hereditary chiefs,” or clan peace chiefs, whose job was to protect the “Innocents,” resolve conflict, and manage inter-national negotiations, and “merit chiefs,” whose selection was based on their various services to the community. Hereditary chiefs were selected exclusively by women for specific council seats held by the clans, whereas merit chiefs were selected exclusively by men; their selection was based on their merit, although hereditarily seats did not exist. For men, in addition to showing mature judgement, one of the ways to earn merit was by acting as a war chief, a position chosen by men after women had given war a go-ahead.’ (306)
o	‘A feud took place after being decided upon in the war council. In this council, lines of relationship played no role since the merit chief, who sat in the war council, was not elected on the basis of clan structures. Thus, feuds were the formal reason for the resolutions of war council, but often this masked the young men’s thirst for adventure and ambitions for advancement. Feuds were carried out based on private initiative of volunteers, and whether or not a feud actually went forward depended completely on the war chief ’s popularity. He would dig up the hatchet (a red-painted tomahawk decorated with red feathers) and plunge it into the village war post. Then, fully adorned and emitting loud war cries, he would begin the war dance. By then, everyone in the village knew that a feud was planned, and those who voluntarily chose to follow the chief joined in the war dance. However, just as often, no one danced with him, and he went home in disgrace.’ (307-308)
o	‘The Iroquois could not undertake feuds without the explicit consent of women. Additionally, the young men who set off in a war party had to be supplied by the women with long-lasting provisions of cornmeal; otherwise, they could not carry out these forays. The women apportioned the food not only for the feuds, but also for the trade expeditions, so the final decisions about these things were in women’s hands. By withholding their political and economic assent, women in the village or town could stop a feud from taking place. And they did stop it, when the elder lineage chiefs thought it was a bad idea.’ (308)
o	‘The house-based council was not only for handling household matters; it was, at the same time, the vehicle for general policy. The chosen representatives of the Ohwachira participated in clan, town, and federal politics. Every Ohwachira had, in addition, the right to launch political initiatives and could convey the Ohwachira’s wishes and expectations to bodies at the nation level and federal level. In this way, households reflected the wishes and claims of all Iroquois—and even of children, as the voting rules weighted a woman’s vote according to the number of children she had. All political opinion and decision-making was based on household councils. Thus, the social and political order presented itself not as a top-down domination, but as a network based on consensus building from below.’ (310)
o	‘If an Ohwachira possessed a hereditary political office, the opportunities for influencing the greater community expanded considerably. The Sachems were chosen in councils made up of the clan mothers and adult women. The Royaneh had the last word, but, once consensus was achieved, she could not overrule it. Aptitude and experience were deciding factors. In this way, women selected the representatives who made up the political bodies in the town, the nation, and in the League. Therefore, these hereditary chiefs acted primarily in the interests of their own clans, particularly the women. Iroquoian women were present at men’s gatherings and heard everything that went on, and so had great political influence and responsibility.’ (310)
o	‘Sachems, or Peace Chiefs, were responsible for quickly resolving conflicts, whether at the town, national, or federal level, and they took the initiative to settle disputes. Nevertheless, by possessing this title, a man became the delegate of his Ohwachira, so that each Sachem was dependent upon the instructions of the Royaneh. In response to poor performance, or headstrong behavior, or infringement of the ideals or laws of the Confederation, she could unseat him. Custom dictated that an offending Sachem would be warned three times: first by the Royaneh acting alone; then by the clan’s male speaker, the Young Man; and finally by the Royaneh and the Young Man together. If all these did not produce results, the Royaneh would revoke the Sachem’s title and his emblems, giving them to another chosen clan representative. The entire clan would of course be paying attention to the Royaneh’s administrative leadership, and she too could be replaced after three warnings’ (310)
o	‘Also at the national councils, the two clan chiefs—Royaneh and Sachem—were present, but the management of this differed among different nations. The Attiwendaronk were a very special group, their national council seems to have had the maximum number of female members possible: four fifths of their council chiefs were women. The clan mothers were in just about total control among the Attiwendaronk. The Confederacy, however, modified that to a more parallel system of national councils as sphere of men, and clan councils as sphere of women. There were also female chiefs at the level of the Confederation; in fact, there were just as many women as men. This was verified by a white woman ethnologist, who herself was a Seneca female chief in the Iroquois Confederation (Harriet Converse).49 During the wars of conquest, the Gantowisas saw themselves as being obliged to assume, in national and federal councils, the roles of imprisoned and murdered Sachems. In these desperate situations the Seneca and Attiwendaronk Gantowisas even took up arms, fighting as soldiers alongside the men: in 1687 the League’s Jigonsaseh personally assumed military control, and handed the French a heavy defeat in 1689, near Montreal.’ (310-11)
o	‘all these kinship groups and political groups were traditionally responsible to the Councils of Elders; these bodies aggregated the experience and wisdom of age and took vigilant care to ensure that Sachems’ decisions were compatible with traditional social values. They were the guardians of the culture’s unwritten laws. However, the women’s councils spoke first and controlled the agenda of both the Grandmothers’ and Grandfathers’ councils’’ (311)

Aptitude and experience were deciding factors. In this way, women selected the representatives who made up the political bodies in the town, the nation, and in the League. Therefore, these hereditary chiefs acted primarily in the interests of their own clans, particularly the women. Iroquoian women were present at men’s gatherings and heard everything that went on, and so had great political influence and responsibility.’ (310)
o	‘Sachems, or Peace Chiefs, were responsible for quickly resolving conflicts, whether at the town, national, or federal level, and they took the initiative to settle disputes. Nevertheless, by possessing this title, a man became the delegate of his Ohwachira, so that each Sachem was dependent upon the instructions of the Royaneh. In response to poor performance, or headstrong behavior, or infringement of the ideals or laws of the Confederation, she could unseat him. Custom dictated that an offending Sachem would be warned three times: first by the Royaneh acting alone; then by the clan’s male speaker, the Young Man; and finally by the Royaneh and the Young Man together. If all these did not produce results, the Royaneh would revoke the Sachem’s title and his emblems, giving them to another chosen clan representative.

The Attiwendaronk were a very special group, their national council seems to have had the maximum number of female members possible: four fifths of their council chiefs were women. The clan mothers were in just about total control among the Attiwendaronk. The Confederacy, however, modified that to a more parallel system of national councils as sphere of men, and clan councils as sphere of women. There were also female chiefs at the level of the Confederation; in fact, there were just as many women as men. This was verified by a white woman ethnologist, who herself was a Seneca female chief in the Iroquois Confederation (Harriet Converse).49 During the wars of conquest, the Gantowisas saw themselves as being obliged to assume, in national and federal councils, the roles of imprisoned and murdered Sachems. In these desperate situations the Seneca and Attiwendaronk Gantowisas even took up arms, fighting as soldiers alongside the men: in 1687 the League’s Jigonsaseh personally assumed military control, and handed the French a heavy defeat in 1689, near Montreal.’ (310-11)

o	‘The Women’s Clan Council, as sole authority at the local level of government, is the first right of women explicitly granted in the Constitution. The second explicit right is that women are the exclusive guardians of war and peace; that is, they had the right to decide these matters. The concept behind this is that, in order to secure the future of society, women and children must have the absolute right to peace and security. To achieve this, Iroquoian women retained the weapons, relinquishing them only when the Women’s Clan Council had resolved to suspend women’s right to peace, having made this public through their spokespersons, the clan mothers or their male speakers. However, in their traditional way of life this happened only very rarely, for the clan mothers were not interested in sacrificing their children’ (306)
o	‘These two political rights of women may seem to imply that the Iroquois gave too much weight to female power, but in their law, an additional provision emphasized male power. This emphasis emerges in the distinction between “hereditary chiefs,” or clan peace chiefs, whose job was to protect the “Innocents,” resolve conflict, and manage inter-national negotiations, and “merit chiefs,” whose selection was based on their various services to the community. Hereditary chiefs were selected exclusively by women for specific council seats held by the clans, whereas merit chiefs were selected exclusively by men; their selection was based on their merit, although hereditarily seats did not exist. For men, in addition to showing mature judgement, one of the ways to earn merit was by acting as a war chief, a position chosen by men after women had given war a go-ahead.’ (306)
o	‘A feud took place after being decided upon in the war council. In this council, lines of relationship played no role since the merit chief, who sat in the war council, was not elected on the basis of clan structures. Thus, feuds were the formal reason for the resolutions of war council, but often this masked the young men’s thirst for adventure and ambitions for advancement. Feuds were carried out based on private initiative of volunteers, and whether or not a feud actually went forward depended completely on the war chief ’s popularity. He would dig up the hatchet (a red-painted tomahawk decorated with red feathers) and plunge it into the village war post. Then, fully adorned and emitting loud war cries, he would begin the war dance. By then, everyone in the village knew that a feud was planned, and those who voluntarily chose to follow the chief joined in the war dance. However, just as often, no one danced with him, and he went home in disgrace.’ (307-308)
o	‘The Iroquois could not undertake feuds without the explicit consent of women. Additionally, the young men who set off in a war party had to be supplied by the women with long-lasting provisions of cornmeal; otherwise, they could not carry out these forays. The women apportioned the food not only for the feuds, but also for the trade expeditions, so the final decisions about these things were in women’s hands. By withholding their political and economic assent, women in the village or town could stop a feud from taking place. And they did stop it, when the elder lineage chiefs thought it was a bad idea.’ (308)

However, this does not mean the Women’s Clan Council had too much power, because it included the consensus not just of the women in the council, but the consensus of the people—all the clan houses, including the women, men, and children who belonged to them.’ (306)
o	‘The Women’s Clan Council, as sole authority at the local level of government, is the first right of women explicitly granted in the Constitution. The second explicit right is that women are the exclusive guardians of war and peace; that is, they had the right to decide these matters. The concept behind this is that, in order to secure the future of society, women and children must have the absolute right to peace and security. To achieve this, Iroquoian women retained the weapons, relinquishing them only when the Women’s Clan Council had resolved to suspend women’s right to peace, having made this public through their spokespersons, the clan mothers or their male speakers. However, in their traditional way of life this happened only very rarely, for the clan mothers were not interested in sacrificing their children’ (306)
o	‘These two political rights of women may seem to imply that the Iroquois gave too much weight to female power, but in their law, an additional provision emphasized male power. This emphasis emerges in the distinction between “hereditary chiefs,” or clan peace chiefs, whose job was to protect the “Innocents,” resolve conflict, and manage inter-national negotiations, and “merit chiefs,” whose selection was based on their various services to the community. Hereditary chiefs were selected exclusively by women for specific council seats held by the clans, whereas merit chiefs were selected exclusively by men; their selection was based on their merit, although hereditarily seats did not exist. For men, in addition to showing mature judgement, one of the ways to earn merit was by acting as a war chief, a position chosen by men after women had given war a go-ahead.’ (306)
o	‘A feud took place after being decided upon in the war council. In this council, lines of relationship played no role since the merit chief, who sat in the war council, was not elected on the basis of clan structures. Thus, feuds were the formal reason for the resolutions of war council, but often this masked the young men’s thirst for adventure and ambitions for advancement. Feuds were carried out based on private initiative of volunteers, and whether or not a feud actually went forward depended completely on the war chief ’s popularity. He would dig up the hatchet (a red-painted tomahawk decorated with red feathers) and plunge it into the village war post. Then, fully adorned and emitting loud war cries, he would begin the war dance. By then, everyone in the village knew that a feud was planned, and those who voluntarily chose to follow the chief joined in the war dance. However, just as often, no one danced with him, and he went home in disgrace.’ (307-308)
o	‘The Iroquois could not undertake feuds without the explicit consent of women. Additionally, the young men who set off in a war party had to be supplied by the women with long-lasting provisions of cornmeal; otherwise, they could not carry out these forays. The women apportioned the food not only for the feuds, but also for the trade expeditions, so the final decisions about these things were in women’s hands. By withholding their political and economic assent, women in the village or town could stop a feud from taking place. And they did stop it, when the elder lineage chiefs thought it was a bad idea.’ (308)
o	‘The house-based council was not only for handling household matters; it was, at the same time, the vehicle for general policy. The chosen representatives of the Ohwachira participated in clan, town, and federal politics. Every Ohwachira had, in addition, the right to launch political initiatives and could convey the Ohwachira’s wishes and expectations to bodies at the nation level and federal level. In this way, households reflected the wishes and claims of all Iroquois—and even of children, as the voting rules weighted a woman’s vote according to the number of children she had. All political opinion and decision-making was based on household councils. Thus, the social and political order presented itself not as a top-down domination, but as a network based on consensus building from below.’ (310)
o	‘If an Ohwachira possessed a hereditary political office, the opportunities for influencing the greater community expanded considerably. The Sachems were chosen in councils made up of the clan mothers and adult women. The Royaneh had the last word, but, once consensus was achieved, she could not overrule it. Aptitude and experience were deciding factors. In this way, women selected the representatives who made up the political bodies in the town, the nation, and in the League. Therefore, these hereditary chiefs acted primarily in the interests of their own clans, particularly the women. Iroquoian women were present at men’s gatherings and heard everything that went on, and so had great political influence and responsibility.’ (310)
o	‘Sachems, or Peace Chiefs, were responsible for quickly resolving conflicts, whether at the town, national, or federal level, and they took the initiative to settle disputes. Nevertheless, by possessing this title, a man became the delegate of his Ohwachira, so that each Sachem was dependent upon the instructions of the Royaneh. In response to poor performance, or headstrong behavior, or infringement of the ideals or laws of the Confederation, she could unseat him. Custom dictated that an offending Sachem would be warned three times: first by the Royaneh acting alone; then by the clan’s male speaker, the Young Man; and finally by the Royaneh and the Young Man together. If all these did not produce results, the Royaneh would revoke the Sachem’s title and his emblems, giving them to another chosen clan representative. The entire clan would of course be paying attention to the Royaneh’s administrative leadership, and she too could be replaced after three warnings’ (310)
o	‘Also at the national councils, the two clan chiefs—Royaneh and Sachem—were present, but the management of this differed among different nations. The Attiwendaronk were a very special group, their national council seems to have had the maximum number of female members possible: four fifths of their council chiefs were women. The clan mothers were in just about total control among the Attiwendaronk. The Confederacy, however, modified that to a more parallel system of national councils as sphere of men, and clan councils as sphere of women. There were also female chiefs at the level of the Confederation; in fact, there were just as many women as men. This was verified by a white woman ethnologist, who herself was a Seneca female chief in the Iroquois Confederation (Harriet Converse).49 During the wars of conquest, the Gantowisas saw themselves as being obliged to assume, in national and federal councils, the roles of imprisoned and murdered Sachems. In these desperate situations the Seneca and Attiwendaronk Gantowisas even took up arms, fighting as soldiers alongside the men: in 1687 the League’s Jigonsaseh personally assumed military control, and handed the French a heavy defeat in 1689, near Montreal.’ (310-11)
o	‘all these kinship groups and political groups were traditionally responsible to the Councils of Elders; these bodies aggregated the experience and wisdom of age and took vigilant care to ensure that Sachems’ decisions were compatible with traditional social values. They were the guardians of the culture’s unwritten laws. However, the women’s councils spoke first and controlled the agenda of both the Grandmothers’ and Grandfathers’ councils’’ (311)

o	‘The Confederation made it possible for the Iroquois peoples to remain sovereign over their vast territories until the end of the eighteenth century.’ (305)
o	‘For all three of these peoples, the deep-seated cultural changes were not confined to ending the priestly-elite; they also led to a new form of government that fundamentally ended hierarchical, male-dominated, hereditary privileges. This was the basis on which the Iroquois created their brilliant Constitution and celebrated Confederation—which is excellent evidence of a great, matriarchally-based society oriented to the common good.’ (301)
o	‘Clans are female, but include males; nations are male, but include females. All matters must circulate in an ongoing process between these two polar powers.’
o	‘Traditionally, the local and federal were interdependent, equivalent entities, rather than having been hierarchically ordered the way they are in patriarchal dominance societies. The local represented the sacred will of the people, the “grassroots level” of Mother Earth herself, and was run by the clan mothers. In the local clan houses, all decisions were made by consensus among all clan members, and all clan houses were represented in the Women’s Clan Council, an elected body presided over by the Jigonsaseh.’ (305-06)
o	‘The federal side, presided over by the men, was made up not of clans, but of nations, as represented in the League of the Nations in the Men’s Grand Council. Although decisions and messages were communicated and handled here, they did not originate here. The men might only discuss an issue after the women had gone over it, which made the Women’s Clan Council the more powerful one— their deliberations effectively set the men’s agenda. Similarly, if the Men’s Grand Council did not dispose of an issue in the way that the Women’s Clan Council preferred, the women could take up the matter anew, reformulate it, and send it back to the men for reconsideration. This means the women’s council retained what amounted to a judicial review of men’s actions, and could stop them; the men’s council could not do the same to the women’s actions.

o	‘The 7,500,000 Igbo who live east of the Niger River traditionally had what Afigbo calls a “democratic village republic” system of political organization, with authority widely dispersed in autonomous units.’ (47)
o	‘The remaining 500,000 Igbo on the western side of the Niger and in the riverine towns of Onitsha and Ossomali, heavily influenced by the kingdom of Benin to the north, developed what Afigbo calls a “constitutional village monarchy” system.’ (47)
o	‘In both types of systems the units were small, and political authority was widely dispersed along the following lines: between the sexes; among lineages and kinship institutions; by age grades; among secret and title societies; and among oracles, diviners, and other professional groups. There was no clear separation between judicial, executive, and legislative functions, and no distinction between the political and the religious in the governmental process. Both systems were what we characterized earlier as dual-sex systems: each sex generally managed its own affairs and had its own kinship institutions, age grades, and secret and title societies.’ (47)
o	The Omu did not derive her status from any linkage to the king (e.g. through power heritage or marriage). She wasn't a queen in the Western sense
o	‘In addition to the omu, her councillors, and the ikporo ani, who represented the entire women’s constituency, there were other women’s political institutions in the traditional Igbo system that function on a small base. Among these were the umuada and the inyemedi, which operated at the village or lineage level. Since Igbo society was exogamous and patrilocal, a woman had to leave her natal village when she married. To deal with the dislocations of this system and insure a simulated lineage structure for married women, a system of reciprocal ties was built up between a woman’s two villages – the one in which she was born and the one into which she married. Women thus came to have two homes. In their natal village they were umuada, or daughters of the lineage and/or village; in the village of their marriage they were inyemedi (co-wives), i.e., co-wives of the village or lineage. In both they formed themselves into an otu (organization), thus giving rise to otu umuada and otu inyemedi.’ (51-52)

The omu gave advice to wives who sought it, and where she felt that she could not handle the situation herself, she and her cabinet sought the cooperation of the obi in council. Such cooperation in cases involving both sexes was the rule rather than the exception, especially in matters involving a man and his wife. Among the Igbo, arriving at a consensus on any major issue was vital. It was not enough for justice to be done; that such justice was done ought to be transparently clear to anybody.’ (50)

Kamene Okonjo (1976)
o	‘The 7,500,000 Igbo who live east of the Niger River traditionally had what Afigbo calls a “democratic village republic” system of political organization, with authority widely dispersed in autonomous units.’ (47)
o	‘The remaining 500,000 Igbo on the western side of the Niger and in the riverine towns of Onitsha and Ossomali, heavily influenced by the kingdom of Benin to the north, developed what Afigbo calls a “constitutional village monarchy” system.’ (47)
o	‘In both types of systems the units were small, and political authority was widely dispersed along the following lines: between the sexes; among lineages and kinship institutions; by age grades; among secret and title societies; and among oracles, diviners, and other professional groups. There was no clear separation between judicial, executive, and legislative functions, and no distinction between the political and the religious in the governmental process. Both systems were what we characterized earlier as dual-sex systems: each sex generally managed its own affairs and had its own kinship institutions, age grades, and secret and title societies.’ (47)
o	The Omu did not derive her status from any linkage to the king (e.g. through power heritage or marriage). She wasn't a queen in the Western sense
o	‘In addition to the omu, her councillors, and the ikporo ani, who represented the entire women’s constituency, there were other women’s political institutions in the traditional Igbo system that function on a small base. Among these were the umuada and the inyemedi, which operated at the village or lineage level. Since Igbo society was exogamous and patrilocal, a woman had to leave her natal village when she married. To deal with the dislocations of this system and insure a simulated lineage structure for married women, a system of reciprocal ties was built up between a woman’s two villages – the one in which she was born and the one into which she married. Women thus came to have two homes. In their natal village they were umuada, or daughters of the lineage and/or village; in the village of their marriage they were inyemedi (co-wives), i.e., co-wives of the village or lineage. In both they formed themselves into an otu (organization), thus giving rise to otu umuada and otu inyemedi.’ (51-52)

from Sharma 1968:
Gana and Sangha are terms used to refer to the republican system of government or the state itself, in which “the supreme power was vested in a considerable portion of the population so qualified only on account of their birth, property or merit. The supreme power was exercised by a few of these rajas, elected from among themselves and more or less responsible to the qualified body who deliberated and took, in consultation with the latter, decisions that were binding on the entire population. The rulers derived their power, not from an individual, human or divine, above them, but from the qualified multitude. In short, it was a “government by discussion.”” p. 12

There are four different forms of such government by discussion in the early vedic period (1500-1000 BC) and a number of republican states still in the Buddhist period (600 – 480 BC)

1.	King, appointed for life by vis (more likely, the elders/heads of families.
a.	This type is widespread in the vedic period
2.	Government by a sabha (council) in a form of aristocratic oligarchy
3.	Government by a sabha (council) and a samiti (Assembly)
a.	In this form of government, the sabha holds the greatest authority
4.	Government by an assembly and an unspecified number of kings (rajanah)

Only types 2-4 are relevant here.

From Stasavage, pp. 36-7
'Rhys Davids highlighted the example of the Shakya—the clan of the buddha. The business of the clan took place in an assembly where both young and old were present, and it must have included taxation. The clan elected a single chief—known as the raja—to run the assembly sessions and to preside over the business of state. Rhys Davids thought that the raja must have had a position like a Roman consul—a presiding officer but not truly a superior.' (p. 36) 'the same texts also describe village governance involving an assembly of all householders' (p. 37)

From Muhlberger 1998
'The largest and most influential Indian literary tradition, the Brahmanical, is distinctly hostile to anything resembling democracy.' (p. 3)
- 'Brahmanical literature gives kingship a central place in political life, and seldom hints that anything else is possible. For moral philosophers and legislators such as Manu (reputed author of the Manu-Smrti between 200 B.C.-A.D. 200), the king was a key figure in a social order based on caste (varna).' (p. 3)
- 'Caste divided society into functional classes: the Brahmans had magical powers and priestly duties, the ksatriyas were the rulers and warriors, the vaisyas cultivators, and the sudras the lowest part of society, subservient to the other three. Moral law or dharma depended on the observance of these divisions, and the king was the guarantor of dharma, and in particular the privileges of the Brahmans.' (p. 3)
- However, 'non-monarchical forms of government were omnipresent' (p. 6); 'it seems that in the northwestern part of India, republicanism was the norm.' (p. 7)
- 'But in many states, perhaps most, political participation was restricted to a subset of all the ksatriyas. 


Culture:
'The Pali Canon, and to some extent the Jaina Canon, show us energetic movements that rejected the hierarchialism and caste ideology seen in the Vedas and Brahmanas in favor of more egalitarian values.' (p. 15)
- 'egalitarianism was an important element in the fifth century B.C' (p. 15)

'The title rājā has frequently been translated as king rather than chief. In many cases the later meaning of the term is applied to these early sources. Yet even in later periods the connotation of rājā has varied from landholder to king. The office of rājā in the Vedic sources was primarily that of a leader in battle and the protector of the settlements.' (Romila Thapar (1991), p. 36)

There are four different forms of such government by discussion in the early vedic period (1500-1000 BC) and a number of republican states still in the Buddhist period (600 – 480 BC)

1.	King, appointed for life by vis (more likely, the elders/heads of families.
a.	This type is widespread in the vedic period
2.	Government by a sabha (council) in a form of aristocratic oligarchy
3.	Government by a sabha (council) and a samiti (Assembly)
a.	In this form of government, the sabha holds the greatest authority
4.	Government by an assembly and an unspecified number of kings (rajanah)

Only types 2-4 are relevant here.

From Stasavage, pp. 36-7
'Rhys Davids highlighted the example of the Shakya—the clan of the buddha. The business of the clan took place in an assembly where both young and old were present, and it must have included taxation. The clan elected a single chief—known as the raja—to run the assembly sessions and to preside over the business of state. Rhys Davids thought that the raja must have had a position like a Roman consul—a presiding officer but not truly a superior.' (p. 36) 'the same texts also describe village governance involving an assembly of all householders' (p. 37)

From Muhlberger 1998
'The largest and most influential Indian literary tradition, the Brahmanical, is distinctly hostile to anything resembling democracy.' (p. 3)
- 'Brahmanical literature gives kingship a central place in political life, and seldom hints that anything else is possible. For moral philosophers and legislators such as Manu (reputed author of the Manu-Smrti between 200 B.C.-A.D. 200), the king was a key figure in a social order based on caste (varna).' (p. 3)
- 'Caste divided society into functional classes: the Brahmans had magical powers and priestly duties, the ksatriyas were the rulers and warriors, the vaisyas cultivators, and the sudras the lowest part of society, subservient to the other three. Moral law or dharma depended on the observance of these divisions, and the king was the guarantor of dharma, and in particular the privileges of the Brahmans.' (p. 3)
- However, 'non-monarchical forms of government were omnipresent' (p. 6); 'it seems that in the northwestern part of India, republicanism was the norm.' (p. 7)
- 'But in many states, perhaps most, political participation was restricted to a subset of all the ksatriyas. 


Culture:
'The Pali Canon, and to some extent the Jaina Canon, show us energetic movements that rejected the hierarchialism and caste ideology seen in the Vedas and Brahmanas in favor of more egalitarian values.' (p. 15)

'The title rājā has frequently been translated as king rather than chief. In many cases the later meaning of the term is applied to these early sources. Yet even in later periods the connotation of rājā has varied from landholder to king. The office of rājā in the Vedic sources was primarily that of a leader in battle and the protector of the settlements.' (Romila Thapar (1991), p. 36)

o	‘The mother is not only the progenitor and head of the clan, but in her role as family priest also embodies a unifying principle. Responsibility for all family rituals lies with her, including the enormously important ceremonies for the dead. She is also custodian of all clan property: the communal house and land, and the income from the work of all the clan members. She inherits her position of official successor to the previous clan mother— her own mother. She is custodian of the clan’s property—not with an eye to her own gain, but for the whole clan, for whose well-being she is responsible. She guides distribution of the common wealth, taking care that it is shared out equally, and according to the needs of each, in a give-and-take economy that could well be called a clan internal “gift economy.” Her responsibility is based on natural bonds, not on abstraction, since all of the clan members are her sisters and brothers, her daughters and sons, for whom she cares. In the clan house, among her close relatives she is possessed of a natural authority, rather than a power over them, as encountered in patriarchal domination roles, where people’s needs and wants are not considered. Natural authority means, on her part, giving advice and, on their part, voluntary choice about accepting it or not: a relationship that develops out of family respect. In the clan house she has no staff of enforcement (no police, no army) to make her suggestions into commands.’ (48)
o	‘All the Khasi subgroups follow the matrilineal principle of descent, succession and inheritance. That means, the children carry the name of the mother’s clan and are members of it. Today the father’s clan is also recognized, and is honored; however, the father’s lineage plays no role, as most of the Khasi continue to emphasize matrilinear kinship and solidarity.’ (48)
o	‘The clan’s property remains in the mother’s clan and is passed on from mother to daughter—with minor variation in the different subgroups. With the Khasi it is the youngest daughter, or “Ka Khatduh,” who takes over the entire ancestral property and the material as well as the spiritual responsibility for the “Kur,” or clan: it is the principle of ultima-geniture. She is supported by her eldest maternal uncle, who carries out the actual management and execution of clan property following the consensus of all clan members. The Ka Khatduh is now the new head and priestess of the clan (sub-clan, lineage) and begins her duties with the funeral rites for her revered dead mother, whose devoted support she was until the last.’ (48-49)
o	‘The clan house is the basic political unit, where decisions are made by consensus in the “Durbar Iing,” or family council, which then sends out senior male clan members to represent them in the “Durbar Kur,” or clan council. The clan councils in turn send male representatives out to the “Durbar Shnong,” or local council. The British colonial government later superimposed a district council, which is a formal justice institution; this took away from the local councils the power to settle cases by consensus.’ (51-52)
o	‘Every durbar meeting takes place only with the consensual agreement of the women: without their agreement, no decision can be made.’ (52)
o	‘Neither is the woman a ruler sui generis, rather she only has the right to make decisions in the context of the clan, conforming to its unwritten rules’ (52)
o	‘Matriarchal societies cannot be labeled as democracies—that is a much later political concept—but rather as consensual clan societies. This means that the decision- making process belongs to all the clan members; their discussions are summarized and brought to completion by the clan mother as chief authority, then represented at the village council by the clan mother’s brother. In this way the U Kni’s role is that of a delegate rather than a ruler. The clan would never permit him to exceed the boundaries of this purely executive role by taking steps of his own. In this sense matriarchies are characterized by non-domination of women even while they hold full economic and spiritual authority.’ (52)
o	‘The role of the Khasi head-persons is a good example: the oldest clans may install the “Syiems” (chiefs, or kings) in the various districts that comprise Khasi Land. Using the case of the well-researched district of Khyrim, we can outline the pattern of this “Syiemship.” The Syiem of Khyrim is the son of the “Syiem Sad,” the high priestess of Khyrim. Not he, but rather she, is the actual head of the people; she allows her son or nephew to act as her delegate. She owns the large royal house, in which a sacred column functions as an axis that designates the center of the (Khasi) world. Symbolically speaking, she lives right at the center of the world. Every official sacrifice ceremony begins through her, at the sacred column, and ends there as well. She is the keeper of the symbols: without the crown and all the sacred tools and sacrificial animals no sacrifice can be celebrated. She always performs the first sacrificial act in the house; afterwards, she turns the tools and the animals over to the Syiem, her son, and lets him continue the ceremony outside. This allows her to watch him from her house’ (53)
o	‘The power of women in the matriarchal official structure was not, however, limited to the Syiem Sad. In the history of the Khasi people there have been instances of female Syiems, or queens, who either performed both functions— priestess and executive—or else were daughters of a Syiem Sad’ (54)

o	‘Matriarchal societies cannot be labeled as democracies—that is a much later political concept—but rather as consensual clan societies. This means that the decision- making process belongs to all the clan members; their discussions are summarized and brought to completion by the clan mother as chief authority, then represented at the village council by the clan mother’s brother. In this way the U Kni’s role is that of a delegate rather than a ruler. The clan would never permit him to exceed the boundaries of this purely executive role by taking steps of his own. In this sense matriarchies are characterized by non-domination of women even while they hold full economic and spiritual authority.’ (52)
o	‘The role of the Khasi head-persons is a good example: the oldest clans may install the “Syiems” (chiefs, or kings) in the various districts that comprise Khasi Land. Using the case of the well-researched district of Khyrim, we can outline the pattern of this “Syiemship.” The Syiem of Khyrim is the son of the “Syiem Sad,” the high priestess of Khyrim. Not he, but rather she, is the actual head of the people; she allows her son or nephew to act as her delegate. She owns the large royal house, in which a sacred column functions as an axis that designates the center of the (Khasi) world. Symbolically speaking, she lives right at the center of the world. Every official sacrifice ceremony begins through her, at the sacred column, and ends there as well. She is the keeper of the symbols: without the crown and all the sacred tools and sacrificial animals no sacrifice can be celebrated. She always performs the first sacrificial act in the house; afterwards, she turns the tools and the animals over to the Syiem, her son, and lets him continue the ceremony outside. This allows her to watch him from her house’ (53)
o	‘The power of women in the matriarchal official structure was not, however, limited to the Syiem Sad. In the history of the Khasi people there have been instances of female Syiems, or queens, who either performed both functions— priestess and executive—or else were daughters of a Syiem Sad’ (54)

o	‘The mother is not only the progenitor and head of the clan, but in her role as family priest also embodies a unifying principle. Responsibility for all family rituals lies with her, including the enormously important ceremonies for the dead. She is also custodian of all clan property: the communal house and land, and the income from the work of all the clan members. She inherits her position of official successor to the previous clan mother— her own mother. She is custodian of the clan’s property—not with an eye to her own gain, but for the whole clan, for whose well-being she is responsible. She guides distribution of the common wealth, taking care that it is shared out equally, and according to the needs of each, in a give-and-take economy that could well be called a clan internal “gift economy.” Her responsibility is based on natural bonds, not on abstraction, since all of the clan members are her sisters and brothers, her daughters and sons, for whom she cares. In the clan house, among her close relatives she is possessed of a natural authority, rather than a power over them, as encountered in patriarchal domination roles, where people’s needs and wants are not considered. Natural authority means, on her part, giving advice and, on their part, voluntary choice about accepting it or not: a relationship that develops out of family respect. In the clan house she has no staff of enforcement (no police, no army) to make her suggestions into commands.’ (48)
o	‘All the Khasi subgroups follow the matrilineal principle of descent, succession and inheritance. That means, the children carry the name of the mother’s clan and are members of it. Today the father’s clan is also recognized, and is honored; however, the father’s lineage plays no role, as most of the Khasi continue to emphasize matrilinear kinship and solidarity.’ (48)
o	‘The clan’s property remains in the mother’s clan and is passed on from mother to daughter—with minor variation in the different subgroups. With the Khasi it is the youngest daughter, or “Ka Khatduh,” who takes over the entire ancestral property and the material as well as the spiritual responsibility for the “Kur,” or clan: it is the principle of ultima-geniture. She is supported by her eldest maternal uncle, who carries out the actual management and execution of clan property following the consensus of all clan members. The Ka Khatduh is now the new head and priestess of the clan (sub-clan, lineage) and begins her duties with the funeral rites for her revered dead mother, whose devoted support she was until the last.’ (48-49)
o	‘The clan house is the basic political unit, where decisions are made by consensus in the “Durbar Iing,” or family council, which then sends out senior male clan members to represent them in the “Durbar Kur,” or clan council. The clan councils in turn send male representatives out to the “Durbar Shnong,” or local council.

Description of the case of self-governance in regards to punishment, where headmen came to a decision that got implemented collectively by both men and women in the community:
-	“I have known of but two or three instances where they have inflicted punishment, and on those occasions their mode was pretty rough one” (Swan, p. 53)
-	[more details of the case1] [ex stabbed the new husband in the back] “this was considered a gross outrage by the rest of the tribe; not the stabbing, but doing it without sufficient cause.” (Swan, p. 53)
-	“The head men deliberated, and at last gathering together a band of friends, they proceeded to the village where the culprit resided, and after first securing him, they pulled out his hair and sacrificed the top of his head.” (Swan, p. 53)
-	“The women finished the scene by pouring salt water on him, and rubbing his head with sand.” (Swan, p. 53)

A case of strict enforcement of punishment for being disrespectful during ceremonies: 
-	“The other instances were for offences committed during the tamanawas ceremonies, and the punishment consisted in having sharp skewers of bone thrust through the fleshy part of the arms between the elbows and shoulders.” (Swan, p. 53)
-	“After they had thus remained a short time, they were pulled out, and stuck in the bark head band, where they were obliged to be worn during the reminder of the ceremonies.” (Swan, p. 53)
-	“In some instances they close the mouth by thrusting these skewers through the lips.” (Swan, p. 53)
-	“This punishment is inflicted on those who laugh at or ridicule the ceremonies” (Swan, p. 53)

A description of punishment “In cases of theft, adultery, or murder..."", where it is upon parties involved to negotiate on further actions:
-	…an opportunity is always offered to compromise the affair by restitution of the stolen property; and by the payment of a certain amount of blankets, guns, or canoes for the other offences; the amount of such payment being decided by the friends of the plaintiff in the case” (Swan, p. 53)
-	“If no such compromise is made, the aggrieved party will take his revenge either on the person who has committed the offence, or on any of his relatives; this revenge will be satisfied by breaking up a valuable canoe, taking forcible possession of any blankets or guns that may be had; or, if the offence consists in murder, by shooting or stabbing the offender or his nearest relative.” (Swan, p. 53)

Thus, a buah gadang was also defined as a collection of the informal 'kaums' or groups. On average 3-4 kaums made a buah gadang (pg. 65)
Being a member of a buah gadang allowed the descendants of former slaves to acquire citizenship of the nagari. 

Land and agricultural produce were usually owned collectively by a kaum. In the case of disputed land between kaums, the buah gadang, which was made of kaums attempted to resolve it amicably.

(Fathauer, p. 97) Mohave are frequently described as warlike, however, Stewart (p. 257) states that people as a whole were pacifically inclined. It was the existence of a distinct class of warriors (Kwanamis) with whom warfare was an obsession among the Mohave that resulted in the frequent warring expeditions. This warring class, just like any other official in Mohave, obtained their status and powers from the spirits in their dreams (Stewart, p. 257). Within a tribe, there were two or three Head Kwanamis who recruited and led the war parties that consisted of the Braves, Kwanamis, and common people (Stewart, p. 260, p. 266; Fathauer, p. 99). People were defined as common if they had not dreamed special powers (Fathauer, p. 99). Another official that accompanied the war party was the Scalper that acted as a Shaman and doctored the warriors (Stewart, p. 269). Scalper was the only one who had dreamed of powers that allowed him to scalp the enemy without being affected by his scalp's magical potency (Stewart, p. 269). 

At home, it was Kwaxot, the main tribal leader, who cared for these war trophies (Fathauer, p. 110). His main responsibility was to ensure tribal integration, which was achieved through his religious position (Fathauer, p. 109). Similarly, this position was obtained from the spirits in a powerful dream (Fathauer, p. 110). 

Decisions regards the tribal internal affairs were conducted through the Informal Council that consisted of Kwaxot and the male heads of each settlement (Fathauer, p. 109). Decisions regards war expeditions, which was a primal aspect of Mohave's external affairs, were conducted through the Conference for Warfare (Fathauer p. 98). There, Mohave's officials such as Kwaxot, Scalper, Head Kwanamis, Braves (Kwanamis) and spies solicited the opinions of some of the wise old men of the tribe (Fathauer p. 98). 

Women played a minor role as their dream was also considered weaker than those of other officials (Fathauer p. 109). Yakatha'alya women would partake in Scalper's ceremony and encourage men to join war parties through shaming (Fathauer p. 109). 

In addition, when Mohave were forced to interact with the Whites, a new official role came to be - Chief for dealing with White People (Fathauer p. 110). Even though, as discussed above, Mohave believed that it was up to spirits to choose the officials by appearing in the special dreams, this was not the case with the Chief for dealing with the Whites (Fathauer p. 109). The first Chief was selected because he was ""lucky"" in his dealings with the Whites, and this position carried on being hereditary (Fathauer p. 109).

(Fathauer, p. 97) Mohave are frequently described as warlike, however, Stewart (p. 257) states that people as a whole were pacifically inclined. It was the existence of a distinct class of warriors (Kwanamis) with whom warfare was an obsession among the Mohave that resulted in the frequent warring expeditions. This warring class, just like any other official in Mohave, obtained their status and powers from the spirits in their dreams (Stewart, p. 257). Within a tribe, there were two or three Head Kwanamis who recruited and led the war parties that consisted of the Braves, Kwanamis, and common people (Stewart, p. 260, p. 266; Fathauer, p. 99). People were defined as common if they had not dreamed special powers (Fathauer, p. 99). Another official that accompanied the war party was the Scalper that acted as a Shaman and doctored the warriors (Stewart, p. 269). Scalper was the only one who had dreamed of powers that allowed him to scalp the enemy without being affected by his scalp's magical potency (Stewart, p. 269). 

At home, it was Kwaxot, the main tribal leader, who cared for these war trophies (Fathauer, p. 110). His main responsibility was to ensure tribal integration, which was achieved through his religious position (Fathauer, p. 109). Similarly, this position was obtained from the spirits in a powerful dream (Fathauer, p. 110). 

Decisions regards the tribal internal affairs were conducted through the Informal Council that consisted of Kwaxot and the male heads of each settlement (Fathauer, p. 109). Decisions regards war expeditions, which was a primal aspect of Mohave's external affairs, were conducted through the Conference for Warfare (Fathauer p. 98). There, Mohave's officials such as Kwaxot, Scalper, Head Kwanamis, Braves (Kwanamis) and spies solicited the opinions of some of the wise old men of the tribe (Fathauer p. 98). 

Women played a minor role as their dream was also considered weaker than those of other officials (Fathauer p. 109). Yakatha'alya women would partake in Scalper's ceremony and encourage men to join war parties through shaming (Fathauer p. 109). 

In addition, when Mohave were forced to interact with the Whites, a new official role came to be - Chief for dealing with White People (Fathauer p. 110). Even though, as discussed above, Mohave believed that it was up to spirits to choose the officials by appearing in the special dreams, this was not the case with the Chief for dealing with the Whites (Fathauer p. 109). The first Chief was selected because he was ""lucky"" in his dealings with the Whites, and this position carried on being hereditary (Fathauer p. 109).

-      The scalper, who was also a shaman, exemplified the connection between warfare and the Mohave ""racist"" philosophy in which non-contamination with foreign blood was always a primary consideration. (Fathauer, p. 108)
-	Warfare was a means of demonstrating tribal prowess and superiority to other tribes. (Fathauer, p. 109)
-	Thus the statuses of kwaxot and axwe satumac (scalper) formed the structural connections for three extremely important themes of Mohave life: warfare, sickness, and tribal continuity through fertility. (Fathauer, p. 109)
-	The scalper was also a tribal official, since only one man occupied this status at any one time. (Fathauer, p. 109)
-	The kwaxot and scalper were in charge of tribal war expeditions as revealed by the fact that scalps could not be taken in the absence of the scalper and that the kwaxot cared for these trophies in the interest of the entire tribe. (Fathauer, p. 109)
-	The ultimate determinant of the statuses a man would occupy depended upon his dreams. (Fathauer, p. 110)
- Mohave warriors feared the magical potency of an enemy scalp; if a man should touch it he would go insane and ""holler in the night."" (Stewart, p. 269)
- Consequently, scalping was performed only by a special scalper, the ahwe somadj (""dream[er] of foes""), who was a shaman rather than a warrior, and who, provided he underwent purification, was unharmed by contact with the scalp. (Stewart, p. 269)
- The ahwe somadj, who dreamed his power to scalp, also doctored warriors who had fallen ill due to contact with the enemy. (Stewart, p. 269)

 hair, he would knock him down, break his neck, and cut off the head with a stone knife. (Stewart, p. 269)",Accompanied and doctored Kwanamis.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

-	This may not be an accurate reflection of aboriginal conditions. (Fathauer, p. 109)
-	The status of xanidal apparently did not exist prior to fairly extensive White contact.  (Fathauer, p. 109)
-	According to several informants, the first chief was chosen after the Whites came, when it became necessary to deal with them. (Fathauer, p. 109)
-	The status was fitted into the aboriginal pattern, but not completely, since, although the chief was supposed to dream his power, the office also became hereditary. (Fathauer, p. 109) 
-	The first chief was selected because he was ""lucky"" in his dealings with the Whites. (Fathauer, p. 109)
-	It appears probable that the status of chief represented an elaboration of the rather vaguely defined status of pataxan, local group leader. (Fathauer, p. 109)
-	The principal tribal status of religious leadership, kwaxot, declined in importance rapidly when the culture began to change under the impact of Whites. (Fathauer, p. 109)
-	The new status of chief lacked the connections with religion and war that characterized that of kwaxot, and appears to have been based upon the status of pataxan, or local group leader. (Fathauer, p. 110)

Role:

Succession:
- Chosen from the chiefly lineage, which was dominant amongst the clans (Fletcher, p. 17)
- Choice of the tribal chief was, in a manner of speaking, electoral, being governed by the principle of tanistry (Fletcher, p. 17)
- Principle of tanistry held that the tribe should be led by the best qualified member of the chiefly house (Fletcher, p. 17)
- At the chief's death, in other words, the succession did not pass automatically, in accordance with any principle of seniority such as primogeniture, but rather was supposed to go to the most competent of the eligible heirs. (Fletcher, p. 17)
- Unless the tribe was very large, most tribal interests were usually best served by a timely resolution of the succession question, and the tribal leaders must ordinarily have managed to keep disruptions to a minimum. (Fletcher, p. 17)

- Tribes or leading tribal families also commonly had special relationships with tribal (or even non-tribal) elements outside the confederation and sometimes even beyond the edges of the steppe. (Fletcher, p. 18)

-	In the absence of written records (or a time machine), there are serious limits to what we can say about kinship and inheritance, or how people in these cities went about making collective decisions. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 294)
-	Still, some clues exist, beginning at the level of individual households. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 294)
-	Each of these had a roughly common plan, but each was also, in its own way, unique.
-	From one dwelling to the next there is constant innovation, even playfulness, in the rules of commensality. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 294)
-	Each family unit invented its own slight variations on domestic rituals, reflected in its unique assemblage of serving and eating vessels, painted with polychrome designs of often mesmerising intensity and made in a dazzling variety of forms. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 294)

-	Individual households would sometimes opt to cluster together in groups of between three and ten families. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 294)
-	Ditches or pits marked their boundaries. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 294)
-	At some sites these groups coalesce into neighbourhoods, radiating out from the centre to the perimeter of the city, and even forming larger residential districts or quarters. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 294)
-	Each had access to at least one assembly house, a structure larger than an ordinary dwelling where a wider sector of the population might gather periodically for activities we can only guess at. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 295)
---------------------------------------------------------

Nebelivka is a mega-site from the Cucuteni-Tripolye culture. A number of other mega-sites have also been documented. Maidanetske seems to be a recreation of Nebelivka's spatial structure a century or two later (there are perimeter boundaries and Assembly Houses creating a 'House -> Neighbourhood -> Quarter -> City' structure). Dobrovody has a similar number of Assembly Houses as Maidanetske, but is missing perimeter boundaries common to the structures of Nebelivka and Maidanetske. Taljanky, the largest mega-site, does not seem to have either of these features. 


-	By 4500 BC, chernozem was widely distributed between the Carpathian and the Ural Mountains, where a mosaic landscape of open prairie and woodland emerged capable of supporting dense human habitation. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 290)
-	The Neolithic people who settled there had travelled east from the lower reaches of the Danube, passing through the Carpathian Mountains. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	We do not know why, but we do know that – throughout their peregrinations in river valleys and mountain passes – they retained a cohesive social identity. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	Their villages, often small in scale, shared similar cultural practices, reflected in the forms taken by their dwellings, female figurines and ways of making and serving food. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	The archaeological name given to this particular ‘design for life’ is the Cucuteni-Tripolye culture, after the sites where it was first recorded. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)

-	So the Ukrainian and Moldovan mega-sites did not come out of thin air. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	They were the physical realisation of an extended community that already existed long before its constituent units coalesced into large settlements. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	Some tens of these settlements have now been documented. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	The biggest currently known – Taljanky – extends over an area of 300 hectares, outspanning the earliest phases of the city of Uruk in southern Mesopotamia. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	It presents no evidence of central administration or communal storage facilities. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)
-	Nor have any government buildings, fortifications or monumental architecture been found.
-	There is no acropolis or civic centre. (Graeber and Wengrow, p. 291)

- In the same two mega-sites with perimeter boundaries —Nebelivka and Maidanetske—a similar pattern of spatial division has been recognized based on four spatial levels—the house, the Neighbourhood, the Quarter, and the entire site (Chapman et al., 2014, 2014a; Ohlrau, 2014). (Chapman, p. 128)

- Turning to the later, Phase CI mega-sites, the basic Nebelivka spatial structure was re-created a century or two later at Maidanetske, with an estimated total of fifteen Assembly Houses and a maximum mean ratio of almost 200 houses per Quarter (Ohlrau, 2014). (Chapman, p. 129)
- A similar number of Assembly Houses is estimated for Dobrovody (Rassmann et al., 2014: 126). (Chapman, p. 129)
- It is even more intriguing, therefore, that only one possible Assembly House has been recognized at Taljanky— after all, the largest known mega-site in the Trypillia world. (Chapman, p. 129)
- The missing perimeter ditch and the absent Assembly Houses at Taljanky seem to us to be two sides of the same coin—an alternative social structure in which different ways of integrating a large population were used in contrast to those at Nebelivka and Maidanetske. (Chapman, p. 129)

- The presence of a perimeter boundary at two mega-sites—Nebelivka and Maidanetske—and their absence from the other two—Taljanky and Dobrovody—suggests major differences in social practices on these sites and the means that they used to integrate subgroups with(out) communal building projects. (Chapman, p. 129)
- The same is true for the absence from Taljanky of Assembly Houses, when these large structures were of such obvious social significance for the mega-sites of Nebelivka, Maidanetske, and Dobrovody. (Chapman, p. 129)

- This is not to say that all mega-structures, whether at Nebelivka or at other mega-sites, will produce identical excavated results. (Chapman, p. 129)
- Yet the first excavation of such a mega-structure has provided an intriguing combination of expanded scale and reduced object deposition. (Chapman, p. 129)
- Further post-excavation studies will doubtless enable us to add more texture and colour to this provocative initial sketch, which contributes another layer of interpretation to the debate on Trypillia ‘urbanism’. (Chapman, p. 129)
---------------------------------------------

Establishment of Nebelivka Quarters:

- Assembly houses were located at a variety of spacings around the outer and inner house circuits. (Chapman, p. 128)
- They occurred in varying combinations: six isolates, five pairs, two trios, and one area with no assembly houses at all. (Chapman, p. 128)
- We consider the location of assembly houses to be of critical importance for the spatial division of the outer and inner house circuits and inner radial streets into the second level of spatial order—the ‘Quarters’. (Chapman, p. 128)
- A critical question concerns the establishment of boundaries between the Nebelivka Quarters. (Chapman, p. 128)
Currently, eight criteria have been used to partition the mega-site into Quarters: (Chapman, p. 128)
(1) ‘Natural’ features, such as palaeo-channels (BUT there are only two palaeo-channels); 
(2) the border half-way between Assembly Houses (BUT this ignores local topographyphies); 
(3) the boundary between (pairs of) Assembly Houses (BUT sometimes there are three Assembly Houses or only one); 
(4) any large gaps between Neighbourhoods (BUT there is often a continuous spread of houses (e.g. E–F, F–G); 
(5) kinks in circuits (BUT these are absent in many parts of the circuit(s));
(6) major variations in the width of the middle (inter-circuit) space; 
(7) gaps in the ditch (BUT some one-third of the outer circuit has no surviving ditch); and 
(8) ‘Obvious’ entrances and passageways (BUT these gaps are not always obvious!).
----------------------------------------------
Assembly House technicalities:

- This mega-structure is currently the largest structure known from the Trypillia-Cucuteni group; the prima facie interpretation would be that such large buildings were some kind of ‘public’ building, performing integrative functions for several parts of the Nebelivka mega-site. (Chapman, p. 120)
- In summary, there were three final stages in the biography of the mega-structure: (Chapman, p. 125)
(1) the temporary or permanent cessation of social practices inside the building; 
(2) a period of as yet unknown duration allowing the build-up of thin levels of Chernozem derived soil layers within the mega-structure; perhaps the mega-structure was not used in this period; and 
(3) two stages of the collapse of the building to produce the ploshchadka.

Each Quarter had at least one Assembly House. No single Quarter seemed to resemble any other Quarter in size or content. As such it seems that there was no centralization. Neighbours would come together in a localized, bottom-up decision-making process. There was a house, a neighbourhood, a Quarter and a city. The structure of the Assembly House also suggests that Nebelivka was not a hierarchical society ruled by elites as the Assembly Houses were bigger versions of the 'typical' Trypillia houses. 

- One of the key structuring elements of the Nebelivka plan is the series of larger-than-usual buildings provisionally termed ‘assembly houses’, on the assumption that these buildings were public places for meetings (Figure 1). (Chapman, p. 128)
- The judicious combination of as many of the multiple criteria as possible [see notes for the 8 criteria examples] has led to a preliminary partition of the Nebelivka mega-site into fourteen Quarters (Figure 1).
- It has been assumed that the location of single, paired, or groups of Assembly Houses was related to the structuring of domestic houses within the Quarters. (Chapman, p. 129)
- It follows, then, that the distance separating Assembly Houses in adjacent Quarters would signify locational regularities (or otherwise) in the overall planning of the Quarters. (Chapman, p. 129)
- This measure of the regularity of planning Quarters reveals a localized, bottom-up decision-making process rather than an overall ‘centralized planning’ that may have resulted in much more regular inter-Assembly Room spacing. (Chapman, p. 129)
- A basic analysis of some of the locational and dimensional ‘regularities’ found at Nebelivka shows how Quarters developed in such markedly different ways that no single Quarter resembled any other Quarter in size or content. (Chapman, p. 129)
- It is improbable that different partitioning of the mega-site would result in a different conclusion from this: namely, that the mega-site developed from the bottom-up within the overall constraints of the basic planning principles. (Chapman, p. 129)
- It is intriguing that such variability could have been produced within identical planning principles. (Chapman, p. 129)
- In short, the Nebelivka mega-structure is, in a sense, much more interesting than a ritual centre with all the trappings of a Late Neolithic temple (cf. Parţa: Lazarovici et al., 2001); it is a massive building with large versions of domestic features—‘mega-features’— but with few objects differentiating the building from ‘typical’ Trypillia houses. (Chapman, p. 127)
- Those expecting the architectural and artefactual reflections of a hierarchical society with elites ruling over thousands of inhabitants in a Trypillia mega-site will be disappointed. (Chapman, p. 127)
- The resultant interpretation of the Nebelivka mega-structure requires a much more subtle model of site depositional practices than we have so far managed to create. (Chapman, p. 127)
- We are left with a building of great size, with a strong element of internal spatial differentiation, but with very few special artefacts. (Chapman, p. 128) 
- There is still little doubt that this is a public building, where meetings, and even ceremonies, could have taken place. (Chapman, p. 128)
- The most obvious place for large meetings would have been the open central area, with its access to four major internal features—the podium, the fired clay bin, and the two largest Raised Areas. (Chapman, p. 128)
- In addition, there may have been access to a set of small drinking-cups at the East end of the central area. (Chapman, p. 128)
- But if those who attended the meetings brought their favourite objects with them, they seemed to have taken many of them away at the end of the ceremonies. (Chapman, p. 128)
- The strong impression at the end of the excavation was of a mega-structure which had imitated the fittings and features of a domestic house on a large scale, without differentiating the megastructure in an artefactual sense. (Chapman, p. 128)
- We can therefore conclude that Trypillia mega-structures did indeed materialize spatial differentiation without the additional elaboration of artefactual differentiation. (Chapman, p. 128)
- The results of the excavation of the Nebelivka mega-structure have interesting implications for our understanding of the question of Trypillia urbanism. (Chapman, p. 129)
- Rather than the creation of a completely new form of public buildings, with special functions materialized in dramatic, often monumental ways (e.g. the monumental temple complexes in the Late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age of southwest Asia (Matthews, 2009; Gates, 2011), Trypillian dwellers were content to reproduce their family houses en gros at certain strategic points of the settlement, with deposition on the same level as in family houses. (Chapman, p. 129)
- But the mega-structure was by no means the same as a ‘normal house’, especially in its paucity of food storage, production, heating, and cooking facilities. (Chapman, p. 129)
- Several principal features (e.g. podium, cruciform Raised Areas) of the mega-structure are also similar to the features well known from Trypillia houses—but the Nebelivka examples are much larger (the podium, the Raised Areas) and more numerous (the Raised Areas). (Chapman, p. 127)
- Preliminary research suggests that the fired clay bin, the largest Raised Area, and podium are the largest examples of their type so far known in the Trypillia culture. (Chapman, p. 127)
- It would appear that the basic elements of the Trypillia house have been borrowed and adapted to fit the great size of what remains a public building but one without the depositional characteristics of a ritual or administrative centre. (Chapman, p. 127)
- The layout of the rooms and internal features in both interpretations of the mega-structure does not fit any of the ‘typical’ domestic house layouts as defined by Chernovol (2012: figure 8.8). (Chapman, p. 127)
- The mega-structure would have been a monumental building, visible from several km on the South part of the micro-region. (Chapman, p. 127)
- Interpretation of the mega-structure: the architectural remains of the Nebelivka mega-structure, together with its associated artefact assemblage, pose an intriguing problem of interpretation. (Chapman, p. 125)
- Before our excavation, the teams shared an expectation of a large public building with a range of special finds, indicating some kind of administrative or ritual central place serving, at the very least, a cluster of houses in the South–East part of the mega-site. (Chapman, p. 125)
- The size of the structure is not in doubt and the excavated remains provided a close match to the 2009 geophysical plan. (Chapman, p. 125)
- However, there was only one part of the mega-structure with anything resembling monumental architectural features—the East threshold with possible monumental wall features (Chapman, p. 125)
- ... This means that anyone approaching the mega-structure from the East side would have been confronted by a 2 m±high wall, with a possibly monumental entrance at the top of a slope. (Chapman, p. 126)
- They would then have entered a loosely integrated structure which was partly roofed, partly open and with markedly different kinds of local ‘spaces’—large open areas, small open areas, larger ‘rooms’, smaller ‘rooms’, and ‘box rooms’. (Chapman, p. 126)
- The overall impression of the finds from the mega-structure is that there are few finds that differ greatly from the ‘typical’ Trypillia house assemblage. (Chapman, p. 126)
- The group of over twenty small fired clay cones is perhaps a sign of an administrative practice (Videiko, 1987: 32–33), but may also be interpreted as gaming pieces (Figure 20). (Chapman, p. 127)
- In general, there is little to make the mega-structure objects stand out from the typical artefact assemblage from a Trypillia house. (Chapman, p. 127)

Institutional mechanisms in the Banjar (hamlet)
- The krama banjar was composed of the citizenry of the hamlet. A man became a member of this after getting married or having his first child. This ensured that each family had a representative in it.
- The krama banjar met once every 35 days, but special meetings could be called. It made all the important policy decisions with consensus. 
- The krama banjar elected the kilan banjar, a set of leaders (the number of which varied from hamlet to hamlet). They were less like rulers and more like the agents of the krama banjar, since they were responsible for the execution of the decisions made by the krama banjar. There were no codified rules dictating their actions, but the kilan banjar followed its own mode of procedure based on past traditions.  
- The krama banjar was ""the sovereign body in all hamlet affairs, ·punishing any incorrigible resistance to its authority, no matter how apparently trivial, by ostracism"" Thus, the banjar enforced its decisions by criticising and shunning those who did not abide by its dictates.  

Institutional mechanisms in the subak (irrigation society)
- the boundaries between rice fields and the extent/usage rights of each irrigation canal were very clearly defined in the constitution (awig-awig subak), which pre-empted water disputes. 
- Structure and powers identical to the hamlet : it had a krama subak, kilan subak and a constitution (awig-awig subak). However, while the domain of the hamlet was political, that of the subak was economic, specifically, the irrigation of rice fields. 
- the members of krama subak (irrigation assembly) did not include representation from all the village, but only large landowners and those who irrigated their terraces from a shared water source, making it an elite assembly. 
- However, its authority and cultural importance was at par with the hamlet's : ""as in the hamlet, in the sphere of life where public rights and public interests were conceived to be dominant its word was law, defiance of its word crime.""

- ""We may recognize the fire-tenders, the head singers, the chorus singers, the drummers, and the masters of ceremonies."" (Barrett, p. 339)
- ""Such offices were considered very honorable and were, as a rule, hereditary."" (Barrett, p. 339) 
- ""This was particularly true of the offices of fire-tender, head singer, and drummer, in which the succession followed precisely the same rules as did the chieftainship."" (Barrett, p. 339)

---Fire-tenders---
- ""The fire-tenders, called me´dze (N) and la´imoc (E), were officials of very great importance."" (Barrett, p. 339)
- ""Connected with each of the large, semi-subterranean ""dance-houses""[3] there were two fire-tenders, who saw to all matters concerning the fire and the preparation of the dance-house except actually procuring the firewood."" (Barrett, p. 339)
- ""All the men participating in the ceremony were supposed to bring wood, which they placed just outside the dance-house."" (Barrett, p. 400)
- ""One of the fire-tenders then carried it up and dropped it through the smoke-hole, while the other stacked it in ricks in the proper places within the house.2 (Barrett, p. 400)
- ""As remuneration for their labor, they received the beads which were thrown at the dancers[4] by the people during the ceremony and which were swept up when the dance-house was cleaned."" (Barrett, p. 400)

---Head singer---
- ""The head singer, called ke´ kai tca (C) and ke´ūya (E), was a man of great importance in ceremonies, though he was very inconspicuous. It was his duty to plan previously the proper sequence of the dances and songs, and it was also his duty to start all songs and to carry the air."" (p. 400)
- ""The head singer had to possess a very good voice, and had to make it his business to know the songs for the various ceremonies."" (p. 400)
- ""Now and then he was at a loss for the proper song for a particular occasion."" (p. 400) 
- ""He was allowed to consult some other singer, or, upon occasion, he might ask for suggestions from the audience."" (p. 400) 
- ""Any one who knew a song which fitted the occasion might come to the head singer and sing it for him in an undertone, until he caught it and was ready to lead in the singing."" (p. 400) 
- ""As a rule he kept time with a split-stick rattle, or a rattle made of cocoons."" (p. 400)

---Chorus/Burden-singers---
- ""The chorus or burden-singers, called skam (E), gave volume to the music and marked time with their split-stick rattles, hai mitamitaka (N)."" (p. 400) 
- ""Their usual burden was ""he, he, he, he, ..."" sung in a heavy monotone."" (p. 400)

---Drummers---
- ""The drummers, called tsīlo´ gaūk (E), tsīlo´ tca (C), and tsīlo´ matūtsī (E), were always two in number, and as a rule they took turns in playing the large wooden drum which was set in the ground at the rear of the dance-house, and which was beaten by the stamping of the feet."" (p. 400) 
- ""The office of drummer was considered one of the most important, and second only to that of fire-tender."" (p. 400)

Master of ceremonies
- ""The master of ceremonies, called xabē´ dima (E), xabē´gaūk (E), and he´līma (C), started and stopped all songs and dances by certain signals."" (p. 400) 
- ""The participants in the dance usually maintained certain positions, but the master of ceremonies ran about from place to place supervising the activities and giving directions as required."" (p. 400) 
- ""His presence was absolutely necessary at all ceremonies, and without him a dance could not proceed."" (p. 401) 
- ""He acted under the general direction of the head captain, but that official himself never served as master of ceremonies."" (p. 401) 
- ""Very rarely did the same individual serve as master of ceremonies and head singer."" (p. 401) 
- ""While as a rule the drummers and the singers wore no special dress for ceremonial occasions, the masters of ceremonies were almost always painted and dressed according to different requirements for each ceremony (see below)."" (p. 401) 
- ""They were usually among the dancers who impersonated supernatural beings."" (p. 401)

Hereditary Captains represented their political blood units. Honorary Captains were there because of their popularity. And the Head Captain was an elected body that announced the decisions made by the Council. 
Council was concerned with general public welfare as well as ceremonies.
These Captains, however, also discussed these matters with other important men.


- ""The special duties of the head captain in olden times were to welcome and entertain visitors from other villages, and to meet in council with the other captains concerning matters of general public welfare, and to arrange for and preside over ceremonies."" (Barrett, p. 339)

- Senate: 'a conservative body in which the oldest and most experienced men had a powerful influence' (p. 36)
- 'Decisions proposed by the Senate had to be confirmed by the third element of the Republican system, the popular assemblies' (Gwynn, David (2012), p. 33, EPUB version). Two main assemblies: Comitia Centuriata and Concilium Plebis
- Consuls: Two consuls in the senate. From 367 BC, even plebeians. 'The magistrates were the officials elected annually from the nobility to run the daily business of government. First and foremost were the two consuls who held the imperium (executive power) once wielded by the king. During their year in office, the consuls were the political and military heads of the state. They presided over the Senate, proposed laws if required, and commanded armies in the field.' (p. 30)
- Hierarchy: patricians and plebeians. Based on blood relations, i.e. only those from patrician families could hold office. Many plebeians owned as much wealth as some patricians.
- Opposition to pro-patrician institutions led to strikes by plebeians in early 4th ce. BC
- Inability to pay creditors led to enslavement
- Patricians allowed the plebeians to have the Concilium Plebis and the tribunes of the plebs, which provided a check on the patrician senate
- 'Eventually, plebeians gained access to almost all major political and religious offices. The distinction between patricians and plebeians by birth still existed, but the Republic’s ruling class had widened and a new aristocracy had emerged which contained both patrician and plebeian nobles. By the early 3rd century, this combined nobility was firmly established. So too were the three key elements that comprised the unique government structure of the Roman Republic: the magistrates, the Senate, and the popular assemblies.' (p. 30)
- 'Below the consuls were lesser magistrates, again elected annually. The major offices were those of praetor, aedile, quaestor, and tribune of the plebs. The praetor was the only magistrate apart from the consul to hold imperium, the right to command armies and preside over the Senate. The authority of the praetor was inferior to that of the consul, and the praetor’s main role was civil and later provincial jurisdiction. Below the praetors were the aediles, who were responsible for the urban maintenance of Rome, including roads, water supply, food, and games. The most junior magistrates were the quaestors, who performed financial and legal duties.' (p. 31)
- 'Ten tribunes were elected each year, and their intended role was to defend plebeians from unjust actions by patrician magistrates. For this reason the tribunes held considerable powers, including the right to intervene in support of a citizen being arrested by a magistrate, the right to veto the action of another magistrate, and the right to propose legislation in the Concilium Plebis. In theory the person of a tribune was sacrosanct, although this did not always protect those who used the office to pursue radical policies, most famously the Gracchi brothers in the 2nd century.' (p. 31)
- 'The other slightly unusual office was that of censor. Two censors were elected approximately every five years, but they held office only until they had completed their functions and never for longer than 18 months. Their primary role was to revise the list of citizens and assess both their property and their morality. This duty included a review of the Senate, into which they could enrol new members and remove any found guilty of improper behaviour.' (p. 31-2)
- 'A consul or praetor at the end of their year in office could be granted an extension of their imperium should the need arise. They then became pro-consuls and pro-praetors, although such extended authority became common only in the 1st century.' (p. 33)
- 'Early Rome had no written legal code. Questions of justice
were decided by customary unwritten law, preserved and
judged by the patricians' (p. 30). Later codified law (e.g. Twelve Tables (c. 450 BC), Lex Hortensia).
- Dictator: 'appointed with superior imperium to oversee the state. A dictator could hold office only for six months or for the duration of the emergency, whichever was shorter.' (p. 33)

- Culture: 
'Women played largely subordinate roles' (p. 35). They were reduced to household carers, priestesses and heroic archetypes which placed the value of family above one's own life (e.g. Lucretia)
'Dignitas' - the sum of individual's and his family's worth and renown. This determined his standing in the Senate. Best way to increase dignitas was through 'gloria' which was best gained in war. 

Regular plebeians were tied to the elite in a patron-client relationship. 'The patron offered protection and financial aid in return for the client’s labour and political support through votes and public displays. It was an informal rather than legal relationship and so was open to abuse, but such abuse was rare.' (p. 38-9)

First and foremost were the two consuls who held the imperium (executive power) once wielded by the king. During their year in office, the consuls were the political and military heads of the state. They presided over the Senate, proposed laws if required, and commanded armies in the field.' (p. 30)
- Hierarchy: patricians and plebeians. Based on blood relations, i.e. only those from patrician families could hold office. Many plebeians owned as much wealth as some patricians.
- Opposition to pro-patrician institutions led to strikes by plebeians in early 4th ce. BC
- Inability to pay creditors led to enslavement
- Patricians allowed the plebeians to have the Concilium Plebis and the tribunes of the plebs, which provided a check on the patrician senate
- 'Eventually, plebeians gained access to almost all major political and religious offices. The distinction between patricians and plebeians by birth still existed, but the Republic’s ruling class had widened and a new aristocracy had emerged which contained both patrician and plebeian nobles. By the early 3rd century, this combined nobility was firmly established. So too were the three key elements that comprised the unique government structure of the Roman Republic: the magistrates, the Senate, and the popular assemblies.' (p. 30)
- 'Below the consuls were lesser magistrates, again elected annually. The major offices were those of praetor, aedile, quaestor, and tribune of the plebs. The praetor was the only magistrate apart from the consul to hold imperium, the right to command armies and preside over the Senate. The authority of the praetor was inferior to that of the consul, and the praetor’s main role was civil and later provincial jurisdiction. Below the praetors were the aediles, who were responsible for the urban maintenance of Rome, including roads, water supply, food, and games. The most junior magistrates were the quaestors, who performed financial and legal duties.' (p. 31)
- 'Ten tribunes were elected each year, and their intended role was to defend plebeians from unjust actions by patrician magistrates. For this reason the tribunes held considerable powers, including the right to intervene in support of a citizen being arrested by a magistrate, the right to veto the action of another magistrate, and the right to propose legislation in the Concilium Plebis. In theory the person of a tribune was sacrosanct, although this did not always protect those who used the office to pursue radical policies, most famously the Gracchi brothers in the 2nd century.' (p. 31)
- 'The other slightly unusual office was that of censor. Two censors were elected approximately every five years, but they held office only until they had completed their functions and never for longer than 18 months. Their primary role was to revise the list of citizens and assess both their property and their morality. This duty included a review of the Senate, into which they could enrol new members and remove any found guilty of improper behaviour.' (p. 31-2)
- 'A consul or praetor at the end of their year in office could be granted an extension of their imperium should the need arise. They then became pro-consuls and pro-praetors, although such extended authority became common only in the 1st century.' (p. 33)
- 'Early Rome had no written legal code. Questions of justice
were decided by customary unwritten law, preserved and
judged by the patricians' (p. 30). Later codified law (e.g. Twelve Tables (c. 450 BC), Lex Hortensia).
- Dictator: 'appointed with superior imperium to oversee the state. A dictator could hold office only for six months or for the duration of the emergency, whichever was shorter.' (p. 33)

- Culture: 
'Women played largely subordinate roles' (p. 35). They were reduced to household carers, priestesses and heroic archetypes which placed the value of family above one's own life (e.g. Lucretia)
'Dignitas' - the sum of individual's and his family's worth and renown. This determined his standing in the Senate. Best way to increase dignitas was through 'gloria' which was best gained in war. 

Regular plebeians were tied to the elite in a patron-client relationship. 'The patron offered protection and financial aid in return for the client’s labour and political support through votes and public displays. It was an informal rather than legal relationship and so was open to abuse, but such abuse was rare.' (p. 38-9)

- 'A consul or praetor at the end of their year in office could be granted an extension of their imperium should the need arise. They then became pro-consuls and pro-praetors, although such extended authority became common only in the 1st century.' (p. 33)

- Dictator: 'appointed with superior imperium to oversee the state. A dictator could hold office only for six months or for the duration of the emergency, whichever was shorter.' (p. 33)

- Culture:

'Dignitas' - the sum of individual's and his family's worth and renown. This determined his standing in the Senate. Best way to increase dignitas was through 'gloria' which was best gained in war. 

Regular plebeians were tied to the elite in a patron-client relationship. 'The patron offered protection and financial aid in return for the client’s labour and political support through votes and public displays. It was an informal rather than legal relationship and so was open to abuse, but such abuse was rare.' (p. 38-9)

- Senate: 'a conservative body in which the oldest and most experienced men had a powerful influence' (p. 36)
- 'Decisions proposed by the Senate had to be confirmed by the third element of the Republican system, the popular assemblies' (Gwynn, David (2012), p. 33, EPUB version). Two main assemblies: Comitia Centuriata and Concilium Plebis
- Consuls: Two consuls in the senate. From 367 BC, even plebeians. 'The magistrates were the officials elected annually from the nobility to run the daily business of government. First and foremost were the two consuls who held the imperium (executive power) once wielded by the king. During their year in office, the consuls were the political and military heads of the state. They presided over the Senate, proposed laws if required, and commanded armies in the field.' (p. 30)
- Hierarchy: patricians and plebeians. Based on blood relations, i.e. only those from patrician families could hold office. Many plebeians owned as much wealth as some patricians.
- Opposition to pro-patrician institutions led to strikes by plebeians in early 4th ce. BC
- Inability to pay creditors led to enslavement
- Patricians allowed the plebeians to have the Concilium Plebis and the tribunes of the plebs, which provided a check on the patrician senate
- 'Eventually, plebeians gained access to almost all major political and religious offices. The distinction between patricians and plebeians by birth still existed, but the Republic’s ruling class had widened and a new aristocracy had emerged which contained both patrician and plebeian nobles. By the early 3rd century, this combined nobility was firmly established. So too were the three key elements that comprised the unique government structure of the Roman Republic: the magistrates, the Senate, and the popular assemblies.' (p. 30)
- 'Below the consuls were lesser magistrates, again elected annually. The major offices were those of praetor, aedile, quaestor, and tribune of the plebs. The praetor was the only magistrate apart from the consul to hold imperium, the right to command armies and preside over the Senate. The authority of the praetor was inferior to that of the consul, and the praetor’s main role was civil and later provincial jurisdiction. Below the praetors were the aediles, who were responsible for the urban maintenance of Rome, including roads, water supply, food, and games. The most junior magistrates were the quaestors, who performed financial and legal duties.' (p. 31)
- 'Ten tribunes were elected each year, and their intended role was to defend plebeians from unjust actions by patrician magistrates. For this reason the tribunes held considerable powers, including the right to intervene in support of a citizen being arrested by a magistrate, the right to veto the action of another magistrate, and the right to propose legislation in the Concilium Plebis.

Introduction of ""simple communes"":
-	""But down into the 16th century there continued to be a vast area, known as “black land”, where it [private landowning] had not yet been introduced."" (Blum, p. 93)
-	""Though quantitative data are lacking, it seems probable that the total extent of the black land exceeded that of privately owned."" (Blum, p. 93)
-	""The practice of turning over black land to private lords became increasingly frequent from the latter part of the 15th century on."" (Blum, p. 93)
-	""As a consequence, the great majority of the peasantry in the 16th century were renters of land that belonged to private proprietors of that was held by pomeshchiks on service tenure."" (Blum, p. 93)
-	""By the 17th century, landowners had broken up most of the old volost’ communes in the Central Non-Black Earth region."" (Moon, p. 201)
-	""They replaced them with smaller and weaker communes, which coincided with their estates."" (Moon, p. 201)
-	""In the 18th and 19th centuries, over ¾ of communes in the European part of Russia coincided with single villages."" (Moon, p. 201)
-	""They were known as “simple communes”.""
-	""There were smaller numbers “split” and “composite” communes."" (Moon, p. 201)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Administration (Institutions):
-	""Many landowners appointed managers (upravlyayushchie) and stewards or bailiffs (prikazshchiki) to administer their estates."" (Moon, p. 202)
-	""They worked with officials from the village communes."" (Moon, p. 202)
-	Communes on lands belonging to monasteries, the state or the court had similar officials. (Moon, p. 202)
-	The names, methods of appointment and duties of peasant functionaries varied from village to village. (Moon, p. 202)
-	In most villages, there was a headman (burmistr), a tax-collector (tseloval’nik) and a clerk (zemskii), who was sometimes a sacristan from the parish church. (Moon, p. 202)
-	Many villages also had elders (starosty), foremen (starshina) and selectmen (vybornye). (Moon, p. 202)
-	They were assisted by overseers (smotriteli) and constables (sotskie, pyatidesyatskie, desyatskie). (Moon, p. 202)
-	Most communes had a churchwardern (tserkovanyi starosta). (Moon, p. 202)
-	Peasant functionaries were either appointed by the landowner, sometimes with the approval of the communal assembly (skhod), or elected by the assembly and confirmed in office by the estate management. (Moon, p. 202)
-	Some peasant functionaries were paid by their landowners or were recompensated by having their seigniorial obligations reduced or waived. (Moon, p. 202)
-	Others received payment from their communes, which raised taxes from their members for this purpose. (Moon, p. 202)
-	More widespread were estates on which landowners (usually absentees) entrusted most administration to communes. (Moon, p. 202)
-	Communal officials ran the villages, and reported back to the landowners, who retained overall control but did not interfere in the internal life of villages. (Moon, p. 202)
-	Such landowners’ interests did not extent much beyond the receipt of the obligations they demanded. (Moon, p. 202)
-      On some estates, with the agreement of the landowner or estate authorities, communes were in charge of issuing passports to peasants who wanted to leave the village to work as migrant labourers. (Moon, p. 225)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Downfalls of this system:
Poor elections:
-	""… findings of a survey of state peasant villages made in the late 1830’s by government inspectors."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""They reported that commune meetings often degenerated into drinking bouts."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""At elections of mir officials the successful candidate frequently turned out to be the man who bought the most drinks for the voters."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""The rich peasants in the commune generally did not run for office themselves."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""Instead, they backed others who, when elected, repaid their wealthy supporters by special favours, such as reductions in the payment they had to make."" (Blum, p. 523)

Poor clergy:
-	""The clerk of the mir enjoyed much power and prestige, for often he was the only person in the commune who could read and write."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""Unfortunately, his learning was usually small and his palm easily crossed."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""As a result, in many communes the account books were in a state of confusion."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""That made it easier for dishonest officials to conceal their misuse or appropriation of mir’s assets."" (Blum, p. 523)
-	""Sometimes these embezzlers stole just small amounts, but on occasion they gave full rein to their acquisitive instincts; the government inspectors discovered that in two communes in Vologda peculations amounted to 32,091 rubles."" (Blum, p. 524)

Excessive power of Proprietor:
-	""On privately owned land every act of the mir was subject to the review of the proprietor."" (Blum, p. 524)
-	""He could cancel any of its decisions, could replace elected officials with men of his own choosing, could command repartition of holdings or forbid it, and, indeed, could disband the commune itself."" (Blum, p. 524)
-	""But such actions were exceptional."" (Blum, p. 524)
-	""Normally the lord, even when he lived on his property and personally supervised its operation, allowed the mir much autonomy, conferred with its leaders before he introduced changes, and turned over to it much of the internal administration of the property."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The mir officials apportioned the obligations the seignior demanded among its members in proportion to the amount and quality of land they had, or to their other sources of income."" (Blum, p. 525)
---------------------------------------------------------------
State Land and the Rules for the Operation of Communes:
-	""On state land the government, in the first part of the nineteenth century, laid down a number of rules for the operation of communes."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""To begin with, it ordered the creation of mirs in every village of state peasants, though small settlements could choose to join the communes of neighbouring larger places."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The law ordered the land of the village to be held communally, and gave the mir the responsibility of dividing it among its members."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The commune could rent additional state-owned land for its own uses, and with official permission could buy and exchange land with private persons, or rent part of its own land to outsiders."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The periodic redistribution of communal land was the mir’s most important function."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The frequency of these repartitions fluctuated widely."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""Often they were carried out after each general revision. "" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""Some communes, however, made general redistributions at shorter intervals such as every six years, and even annual redistributions were not unknown."" (Blum, p. 525)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Starozhil’tsy vs Novoprikhodtsy vs Polovnik peasants:
Peasant were categorised as Starozhil’tsy (old inhabitants),  Novoprikhodtsy (newcomers) or Polovnik (sharecroppers)
-	Newcomers were excused from all or part of the obligations. (Blum, p. 98)
-	Peasant was a newcomer for a set period of time agreed between the landlord and the new peasant on his arrival. (Blum, p. 98)
-	It ran usually from 5 to 15 years. (Blum, p. 98)
-	Polovnik greed to remain with the lord for an agreed upon number of years and to pay a fixed proportion of his crop to the lord as rental. (Blum, p. 100)
-	On his arrival polovnik received a loan of cash or of grain from the landlord in order to get started on his farming, and to carry him over until he brought in his first crop. (Blum, p. 100)


------------------------------------------------------------
Size:
- In the early centuries of Russia's history the peasants whether black people or renters on privately owned land, lived usually in isolated farmsteads or in tiny hamlets. (Blum, p. 504)
- This pattern of settlement persisted well into the 16th century. (Blum, p. 504)
- Then peasants began to give up living in isolated farmsteads and came together into villages. (Blum, p. 504)
- (1850s) In terms of population rather than number of homesteads the most common settlement size was between 51 and 300 people. (Blum, p. 506)
Out of 100,299 settlements:
5.2%  (5,238) had fewer than 10 inhabitants
22.5% (22,456) had between 11 and 50
53% (53,077) had between 51 and 300
8.5% (8,593) had between 301 and 500
6.6% (6,651) had between 501 and 1,000
3.0% (3,030) had between 1,001 and 2,000
1.2% (1,254) had between 2,001 and 25,000

- Estimates of the total population of Russia at the end of the 16th century vary between 2.5-2.9 million and 11 million, but a figure of 7 million seems plausible. (Moon, p. 20)
- On 28 January 1897 the first, and only, general census of the population of the Russian Empire was held. (Moon, p. 11)
- The 1897 census: total population of 125.6 million. (Moon, p. 12)",16th-19th century AD,1500,1900,Europe East,"1,000,001 - 10,000,000","'- Moon, David, the Russian Peasantry 1600-1930: The World the Peasants Made, 1999.

-	""Sometimes these embezzlers stole just small amounts, but on occasion they gave full rein to their acquisitive instincts; the government inspectors discovered that in two communes in Vologda peculations amounted to 32,091 rubles."" (Blum, p. 524)

-	""On privately owned land every act of the mir was subject to the review of the proprietor."" (Blum, p. 524)

State Land and the Rules for the Operation of Communes:
-	""On state land the government, in the first part of the nineteenth century, laid down a number of rules for the operation of communes."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""To begin with, it ordered the creation of mirs in every village of state peasants, though small settlements could choose to join the communes of neighbouring larger places."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The law ordered the land of the village to be held communally, and gave the mir the responsibility of dividing it among its members."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The commune could rent additional state-owned land for its own uses, and with official permission could buy and exchange land with private persons, or rent part of its own land to outsiders."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The periodic redistribution of communal land was the mir’s most important function."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The frequency of these repartitions fluctuated widely."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""Often they were carried out after each general revision. "" (Blum, p. 525)

Starozhil’tsy vs Novoprikhodtsy vs Polovnik peasants:
Peasant were categorised as Starozhil’tsy (old inhabitants),  Novoprikhodtsy (newcomers) or Polovnik (sharecroppers)
-	Newcomers were excused from all or part of the obligations. (Blum, p. 98)
-	Peasant was a newcomer for a set period of time agreed between the landlord and the new peasant on his arrival. (Blum, p. 98)
-	It ran usually from 5 to 15 years. (Blum, p. 98)
-	Polovnik greed to remain with the lord for an agreed upon number of years and to pay a fixed proportion of his crop to the lord as rental. (Blum, p. 100)
-	On his arrival polovnik received a loan of cash or of grain from the landlord in order to get started on his farming, and to carry him over until he brought in his first crop. (Blum, p. 100)

Size:
- In the early centuries of Russia's history the peasants whether black people or renters on privately owned land, lived usually in isolated farmsteads or in tiny hamlets. (Blum, p. 504)
- This pattern of settlement persisted well into the 16th century. (Blum, p. 504)
- Then peasants began to give up living in isolated farmsteads and came together into villages. (Blum, p. 504)
- (1850s) In terms of population rather than number of homesteads the most common settlement size was between 51 and 300 people. (Blum, p. 506)
Out of 100,299 settlements:
5.2%  (5,238) had fewer than 10 inhabitants
22.5% (22,456) had between 11 and 50
53% (53,077) had between 51 and 300
8.5% (8,593) had between 301 and 500
6.6% (6,651) had between 501 and 1,000
3.0% (3,030) had between 1,001 and 2,000
1.2% (1,254) had between 2,001 and 25,000

- Estimates of the total population of Russia at the end of the 16th century vary between 2.5-2.9 million and 11 million, but a figure of 7 million seems plausible. (Moon, p. 20)
- On 28 January 1897 the first, and only, general census of the population of the Russian Empire was held. (Moon, p. 11)

-	""On state land the government, in the first part of the nineteenth century, laid down a number of rules for the operation of communes."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""To begin with, it ordered the creation of mirs in every village of state peasants, though small settlements could choose to join the communes of neighbouring larger places."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The law ordered the land of the village to be held communally, and gave the mir the responsibility of dividing it among its members."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The commune could rent additional state-owned land for its own uses, and with official permission could buy and exchange land with private persons, or rent part of its own land to outsiders."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The periodic redistribution of communal land was the mir’s most important function."" (Blum, p. 525)
-	""The frequency of these repartitions fluctuated widely."" (Blum, p. 525)

Starozhil’tsy vs Novoprikhodtsy vs Polovnik peasants:
Peasant were categorised as Starozhil’tsy (old inhabitants),  Novoprikhodtsy (newcomers) or Polovnik (sharecroppers)
-	Newcomers were excused from all or part of the obligations. (Blum, p. 98)
-	Peasant was a newcomer for a set period of time agreed between the landlord and the new peasant on his arrival. (Blum, p. 98)
-	It ran usually from 5 to 15 years. (Blum, p. 98)
-	Polovnik greed to remain with the lord for an agreed upon number of years and to pay a fixed proportion of his crop to the lord as rental. (Blum, p. 100)
-	On his arrival polovnik received a loan of cash or of grain from the landlord in order to get started on his farming, and to carry him over until he brought in his first crop. (Blum, p. 100)

Size:
- In the early centuries of Russia's history the peasants whether black people or renters on privately owned land, lived usually in isolated farmsteads or in tiny hamlets. (Blum, p. 504)
- This pattern of settlement persisted well into the 16th century. (Blum, p. 504)
- Then peasants began to give up living in isolated farmsteads and came together into villages. (Blum, p. 504)
- (1850s) In terms of population rather than number of homesteads the most common settlement size was between 51 and 300 people. (Blum, p. 506)
Out of 100,299 settlements:
5.2%  (5,238) had fewer than 10 inhabitants
22.5% (22,456) had between 11 and 50
53% (53,077) had between 51 and 300
8.5% (8,593) had between 301 and 500
6.6% (6,651) had between 501 and 1,000

-	Peasant was a newcomer for a set period of time agreed between the landlord and the new peasant on his arrival. (Blum, p. 98)
-	It ran usually from 5 to 15 years. (Blum, p. 98)
-	Polovnik greed to remain with the lord for an agreed upon number of years and to pay a fixed proportion of his crop to the lord as rental. (Blum, p. 100)
-	On his arrival polovnik received a loan of cash or of grain from the landlord in order to get started on his farming, and to carry him over until he brought in his first crop. (Blum, p. 100)

Size:
- In the early centuries of Russia's history the peasants whether black people or renters on privately owned land, lived usually in isolated farmsteads or in tiny hamlets. (Blum, p. 504)
- This pattern of settlement persisted well into the 16th century. (Blum, p. 504)
- Then peasants began to give up living in isolated farmsteads and came together into villages. (Blum, p. 504)
- (1850s) In terms of population rather than number of homesteads the most common settlement size was between 51 and 300 people. (Blum, p. 506)
Out of 100,299 settlements:
5.2%  (5,238) had fewer than 10 inhabitants
22.5% (22,456) had between 11 and 50
53% (53,077) had between 51 and 300
8.5% (8,593) had between 301 and 500
6.6% (6,651) had between 501 and 1,000
3.0% (3,030) had between 1,001 and 2,000
1.2% (1,254) had between 2,001 and 25,000

- Estimates of the total population of Russia at the end of the 16th century vary between 2.5-2.9 million and 11 million, but a figure of 7 million seems plausible. (Moon, p. 20)
- On 28 January 1897 the first, and only, general census of the population of the Russian Empire was held. (Moon, p. 11)
- The 1897 census: total population of 125.6 million. (Moon, p. 12)",16th-19th century AD,1500,1900,Europe East,"1,000,001 - 10,000,000","'- Moon, David, the Russian Peasantry 1600-1930: The World the Peasants Made, 1999.

""The first type he mentions is the ‘meeting specially called for discussing some particularly important matter for the community at large, usually involving the respectability of one or more of the leading members of the village.’ ‘Only matai’ or titled chiefs, Duranti says, ‘participate in this kind of fono; in fact the right (and duty) of participation in such meetings is one of the defining features of matai status.’ Besides these chiefly fono, though, there are also fono komiti fafine, women’s committee meetings, where the women of the village’ assemble ‘to plan and discuss public health projects or the organization of mat production in the village;’ fono o tupua ma le aumaga, in which ‘untitled men talk about the organization of work that is needed for the activities of the titled men and practice speech-making;’ and fono o le pulenu’u, village meeting with village-level represenatives (pulenu’u) who can then channel relevant concerns to a higher administrative level.""

""In Schwyz, Uri, Unterwalden, Appenzell and Glarus, the assemblies of the citizens acted as the supreme powers. In Schwyz, these assemblies were held once a year on the last Sunday in May. When questions of crucial importance were left unresolved at this
meeting, a second one was summoned two or three weeks later. The assembly acted as a high court of justice, decided on new laws and charters, ratified treaties and elected the main office-holders of the canton. The head of the administration (Landamann), his deputy (Statthalter) and the treasurer (Sa¨ckelmeister) served for two years. Other officers and members of the court were appointed by the assembly for life. The members the council served as custodians of the assembly’s rights between sessions and were elected by local meetings held by each of the six quarters. They were responsible for their acts to the assembly and all acknowledged the assembly as the
supreme power of the canton. Although office-holders usually proposed the agenda, any member of the assembly had the right to put forward a motion. Freedom of speech was guaranteed. Once a resolution had been passed, every citizen was expected to obey

Major developments in the 16th and 17th centuries as city-states yield to cantons as primary political units. Entry based on the period of the cantons and focused on the ""rural"" cantons, where democratic and participatory forms predominated. 

Distinction between urban (aristocratic) and rural (democratic) cantons, but more in theory than in practice. On the one hand, democracy in rural cantons may have been captured by the elites (p. 193). On the other hand, for the urban cantons, Lau suggests that: ""The democratic heritage of Switzerland’s early modern cities has divided experts. The important decisions were made by a small elite (Goppold 2007). The towns were places where personal contacts were more important than the rituals of the assemblies, so, whatever the formal position, ordinary citizens hardly had a share in political power.

'Starting in 1032, the Doge’s authority was limited through the establishment of advisory councils until it was de facto altered from an elected monarchy to a republican magistracy. In 1172 it was established that a Doge should never act contrary to the advice of his councilors.' (p. 644)

'The conduct of all officials (including the Doge) was subject to scrutiny by committees to prevent unlawful gains.' (p. 644)

From Gonzales de lara et al. 2008:
'there were no formal constitutional rules limiting the doge's power. Once elected, the doge had absolute power with unlimited authority over all constitutional, administrative, political, and military matters. The factor that prevented doges from de facto assuming dictatorial powers was not the expectation of popular retaliation, as the coordination view might suggest. Rather, doges were constrained by a number of rival clans with relatively high administrative capacities.' (González de Lara (2008), p. 106)

'Various councils and magistracies were given overlapping jurisdictions, so that each was monitored by others. Office holders were legally required to notify the State Attorneys of any observed wrongdoings.'
